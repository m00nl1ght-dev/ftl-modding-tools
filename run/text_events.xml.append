<text name="ce_textList_CE_PRE_FIGHT_TEXT_3">Here they come!</text>
<text name="ce_textList_CE_PRE_FIGHT_TEXT_4">No turning back here.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_CE_PRE_FIGHT_TEXT_5">For the Federation!</text>
<text name="ce_textList_CE_PRE_FIGHT_TEXT_6">The enemy is close.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_CE_PRE_FIGHT_TEXT_7">Another battle is imminent.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_CE_PRE_FIGHT_TEXT_8">Once more you get the ship ready for battle.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_CE_PRE_FIGHT_TEXT_9">The ship's computer informs the crew, "Threat level 2 hostile approaching. Armed engagement imminent."</text>
<text name="ce_textList_CE_PRE_FIGHT_TEXT_10">The ship's computer reassures the crew, "Simulations show good success chances for this engagement. Remain calm and do your job."</text>
<text name="ce_textList_CE_PRE_FIGHT_TEXT_11">Red lights flicker on your console. The enemy is rated threat level 3.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_CE_PRE_FIGHT_TEXT_12">You calmly sit down in the Captain's chair and give the final order, "Engage!"</text>
<text name="ce_textList_CE_PRE_FIGHT_TEXT_13">Sirens blare on board the ship... Battle Stations!</text>
<text name="ce_textList_CE_PRE_FIGHT_TEXT_14">Combat is imminent. You get to your console and sound the alert.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_CE_PRE_FIGHT_TEXT_15">The crew runs for their stations.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_CE_PRE_FIGHT_TEXT_16">Everyone on board braces for impacts.</text>

<text name="ce_textList_CE_PRE_FIGHT_TEXT_21">Your crew reports: "We are moving in hot."</text>
<text name="ce_textList_CE_PRE_FIGHT_ION_TEXT_1">The enemy's shields flicker and fade as their protective layers collapse. That should soften them up a bit!</text>
<text name="ce_textList_CE_PRE_FIGHT_ION_TEXT_2">The enemy's shields start to crackle, sending electric discharges everywhere. It seems the ion field works well.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_CE_PRE_FIGHT_ION_TEXT_3">Lightning flashes from the enemy's shields. One of their bubbles collapses and stays down.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_CE_PRE_FIGHT_ION_TEXT_4">The ion field depletes one of the enemy's shield bubbles.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_CE_PRE_FIGHT_ION_TEXT_5">You crew reports, "Good effect on target, Captain. Enemy defenses weakened."</text>
<text name="ce_textList_CE_PRE_FIGHT_ION_TEXT_6">"Their shields are collapsing, Captain." You move in to engage.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_CE_PRE_FIGHT_ION_TEXT_7">That should soften them up a bit.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_CE_PRE_FIGHT_ION_TEXT_8">The field projector initially has trouble keeping a lock, but their defenses soon succumb.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_CE_PRE_FIGHT_ION_TEXT_9">Your augment once again disrupts the opponent's shield projection.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_CE_PRE_FIGHT_TELEPORTER_TEXT_1">A reassuring green light on your console tells you that the teleporter disruptor is online. The enemy will have trouble trying to board you.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_CE_PRE_FIGHT_TELEPORTER_TEXT_2">A graphic on the vidscreen illustrates how the disruption field unfolds. The enemy's teleporter signals are scrambled.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_CE_PRE_FIGHT_TELEPORTER_TEXT_3">"Disruptor field stable, Captain. That should keep them away." You move in to attack.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_CE_PRE_FIGHT_TELEPORTER_TEXT_4">Your augment once again disrupts the opponent's teleporters.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_CE_PRE_FIGHT_BIOWEAPON_TEXT_1">"Captain?" Your crew awaits verification of the order. You ignore their concerns and order the activation of the bio weapon. The enemy crew will suffer greatly, unless their life support system is quite advanced.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_CE_PRE_FIGHT_BIOWEAPON_TEXT_2">"Eh... right, targeting radiation projector..." Your crew seems to be quite disturbed by the excessive use of this weapon.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_CE_PRE_FIGHT_BIOWEAPON_TEXT_3">Show the enemy no mercy.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_CE_PRE_FIGHT_BIOWEAPON_TEXT_4">Your First Mate reports, "Radiation projector deployed, Captain. Good effect on target."</text>
<text name="ce_textList_CE_PRE_FIGHT_BIOWEAPON_TEXT_5">Your First Mate nods silently. Your augment begins to irradiate the enemy vessel.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_CE_RESIST_WEAPON_JAMMING_TEXT_1">Your targeting computer anticipates the enemy's movements, making your systems less dependent on direct tracking and allowing you to lock on with your full weapon cluster. Prepare to fire!</text>
<text name="ce_textList_CE_RESIST_WEAPON_JAMMING_TEXT_2">Semi-manual targeting is jammed, but your computer does most of the work anyway.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_CE_RESIST_WEAPON_JAMMING_TEXT_3">The enemy's jamming field prevents you from effectively tracking the ship, but your advanced targeting hardware is able to cope with just the little data it gets. All weapons can be readied and fired.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_CE_RESIST_ICEFIELD_TEXT_1">Your black-body field will hide you even without background radiation. Your opponent won't see you coming.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_CE_RESIST_ICEFIELD_TEXT_2">"Let's show them what this vessel is really capable of." The heat-sink field leaves no trace of your ship, even in this sensor friendly region.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_CE_RESIST_ICEFIELD_TEXT_3">Your engineer is happy to get a chance to push the stealth capabilities of your vessel to the max. The crew lets the ship run on minimal systems and gets the black body field up. You remain extremely hard to trace, even in this ice-field.</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_CE_RESIST_CLOAK_HACK_1">Stealth systems are naturally protected by strong firewalls; the enemy hack can only cause small glitches. Normally this would be enough to make you traceable, but with your advanced stealth equipment you will be able to stay hidden. They still won't see you coming like this.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_CE_RESIST_DRONE_JAMMING_TEXT_1">"Sending now, Captain." The uploaded micro AI components will allow the drones to function even though the communication up-link with your ship is scrambled.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_CE_RESIST_DRONE_JAMMING_TEXT_2">With the improved AI taking over drone communication, barely any connection is needed for the drones to execute their tasks. The signal jamming here will not affect your drones' performance.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_CE_RESIST_DRONE_JAMMING_TEXT_3">You use what little signal strength you have left to activate the drones' autonomous AI routines. The machines will be able to anticipate your commands, allowing them to function even with barely any clear commands given.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_CE_RESIST_ION_TEXT_1">Your augmented projectors keep your shields up, even with the ion field present.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_CE_RESIST_ION_TEXT_2">Your advanced field projectors can negate the effect of the ion field. This should keep your defenses up.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_CE_RESIST_ION_TEXT_3">A few redundant projectors get fried, but you manage to keep the shields up despite the ion field. Time to focus on the hostile.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_CE_RESIST_ION_TEXT_4">The projector is straining beyond its limits, but you allow some redundant components to fry in order to keep the shields up. The crew reports that your defenses remain fully functional.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_CE_RESIST_ION_TEXT_5">Lightning arcs from the projectors as you struggle to keep the shields up. Steady now! Looks like this will work...</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_CE_PRE_FIGHT_NEBULA_SCANNER_1_c2">(Internal Generator) Use your internal generator to power this augment.</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_CE_PRE_FIGHT_NEBULA_SCANNER_1_c3">(Internal Generator) Use your internal generator to power up a secondary combat augment.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_CE_PRE_FIGHT_NEBULA_SCANNER_TEXT_1">Nothing will escape you, even within these clouds. Your vision is augmented.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_CE_PRE_FIGHT_NEBULA_SCANNER_TEXT_2">The device scans in more than three dimensions and produces images that are impossible to comprehend for most individuals. You are glad that the sensor system converts the data into something you can work with.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_CE_PRE_FIGHT_NEBULA_SCANNER_TEXT_3">Your augmented sensors easily pick up the enemy. You get as much data as you usually would.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_CE_PRE_FIGHT_NEBULA_SCANNER_TEXT_4">No one exactly knows how this advanced scanning tech of the Slug actually works. It allows your sensors to function even within this cloud, somehow.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_CE_PRE_FIGHT_NEBULA_SCANNER_TEXT_5">You augmented scanner can provide detailed data on the ship, even within this cloud.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_CE_PRE_FIGHT_NEBULA_SCANNER_TEXT_6">The scanner gives you a detailed subspace image, but you will still need regular sensors to interpret it.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_CE_PRE_FIGHT_CLOAK_BREAK_TEXT_1">You lock on to the enemy with your full subspace scanner array. Now the opponent won't be able to hide within a cloak field.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_CE_PRE_FIGHT_CLOAK_BREAK_TEXT_2">Your augmented sensors easily track the enemy. They won't be able to slip into cloak, should they try to.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_CE_PRE_FIGHT_CLOAK_BREAK_TEXT_3">You augmented scanner can track the position of the hostile, even when they should try to cloak.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_CE_PRE_FIGHT_CLOAK_BREAK_TEXT_4">The scanner gives you a detailed subspace image. Unless your enemy has very advanced cloaking capabilities, it won't be able to hide from you.</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_CE_PRE_FIGHT_ASB_11">This enemy seems to be equipped with some kind of scrambler plating. Your weapon platform reports that it is unable to lock onto the enemy. If it fires, it might hit your ship as well.</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_CE_PRE_FIGHT_ASB_11_c1">Tell the AI to stand down.</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_CE_PRE_FIGHT_ASB_11_c1_e">The weapon platform activates its passive cloak. You can retrieve it later; for now you will have to take care of the hostile, without fire support.</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_CE_PRE_FIGHT_ASB_11_c2">Order the AI to fire anyway.</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_CE_PRE_FIGHT_ASB_11_c2_e">You override the safety protocols and the weapon platform starts firing full spread salvos. This is going to be a vicious fight.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_CE_PRE_FIGHT_ASB_TEXT_1">The crew quickly finishes the last preparations. You release the weapon platform and head towards the hostile.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_CE_PRE_FIGHT_ASB_TEXT_2">The crew runs for the hangar bay and arms the autonomous weapon platform. It is released through an airlock and speeds away, priming its anti-ship main guns.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_CE_PRE_FIGHT_ASB_TEXT_3">Hectic activity fills the ship as crewmen run for the hangar and prepare the weapon platform. It is ready and dispatched before your enemy gets a first shot off.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_CE_PRE_FIGHT_ASB_TEXT_4">Small carts with ammunition are rolled towards the hangar. The rearming procedure is completed before the battle begins and you head towards the hostile.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_CE_PRE_FIGHT_ASB_TEXT_5">"Roger, Captain, we are on it. Our ASB will start firing shortly."</text>
<text name="ce_textList_CE_PRE_FIGHT_ASB_TEXT_6">The hangar doors open and the small weapon platform races into the darkness. It will begin firing shortly.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_CE_PRE_FIGHT_ASB_TEXT_7">"Engineering reports: ASB armed and ready, Captain. Dispatching now."</text>
<text name="ce_textList_CE_PRE_FIGHT_ASB_TEXT_8">"ASB fully responsive, Captain. Shells incoming."</text>
<text name="ce_textList_CE_PRE_FIGHT_ASB_TEXT_9">The autonomous AI confirms its fire mission: "Target received... Priming main clusters... Commencing attack in..."</text>
<text name="ce_textList_CE_PRE_FIGHT_ASB_TEXT_10">The autonomous AI reports its status: "Target acquired."</text>
<text name="ce_textList_CE_PRE_FIGHT_ASB_TEXT_11">The weapon AI reports: "Ammo capacity='100' Dispense Options='minimal_spread' ... - Beginning dispensing in: 10 ... 9 ... 8 ..."</text>
<text name="ce_textList_CE_PRE_FIGHT_ASB_TEXT_12">You release the weapon platform far away from the hostile and then head into battle.</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_CE_PRE_FIGHT_ASB_2_11">The weapon platform reports it has problems locking onto the enemy. You navigate to close to your opponent; if the ASB fires, it might hit your ship as well.</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_CE_PRE_FIGHT_ASB_2_11_c1">Tell the AI to stand down and fight the hostile without fire support.</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_CE_PRE_FIGHT_ASB_2_11_c1_e">The weapon platform activates its passive cloak. You can retrieve it later, for now you will have to deal with the hostile.</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_CE_PRE_FIGHT_ASB_2_12">This enemy seems to be equipped with some kind of scrambler plating; the weapon platform reports that it is unable to locking onto the enemy.</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_CE_PRE_FIGHT_ASB_2_13">"Something is not right here, Captain. The ASB is unresponsive." Your enemy is equipped with an internal hacking device. It has taken over your weapon platform and turned it against you!</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_CE_PRE_FIGHT_EFFECTOR_1">Your effector device starts to generate a strong ion field. "Target, Captain?"</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_CE_PRE_FIGHT_EFFECTOR_1_c2">Drone Control.</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_CE_PRE_FIGHT_EFFECTOR_1_c3">Artillery.</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_CE_PRE_FIGHT_EFFECTOR_1_c3_e">The effector infiltrates its way into the enemy artillery system and reroutes power away from it. That should increase the charge time significantly.</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_CE_PRE_FIGHT_EFFECTOR_1_c4_e">Your effector manages to disable one of the enemy's shield projectors. This should weaken their defenses.</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_CE_PRE_FIGHT_EFFECTOR_1_c5">Engines.</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_CE_PRE_FIGHT_EFFECTOR_1_c5_e">The effector disables the primary thrusters of the enemy craft.</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_CE_PRE_FIGHT_EFFECTOR_1_c6">Cloaking.</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_CE_PRE_FIGHT_EFFECTOR_1_c6_e">Your effector augment disables the enemy cloaking system.</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_CE_PRE_FIGHT_EFFECTOR_1_c7">Other system.</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_CE_PRE_FIGHT_EFFECTOR_1_c7_e_c1">Teleporter.</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_CE_PRE_FIGHT_EFFECTOR_1_c7_e_c1_e">Your effector unit disrupts the enemy teleporter targeting. It will be harder for your opponent to get a teleporter lock on your ship.</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_CE_PRE_FIGHT_EFFECTOR_1_c7_e_c2">Hacking.</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_CE_PRE_FIGHT_EFFECTOR_1_c7_e_c2_e">Your effector unit tries to counter the enemy hacking attempts.</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_CE_PRE_FIGHT_EFFECTOR_1_c7_e_c3">Mind Control.</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_CE_PRE_FIGHT_EFFECTOR_1_c7_e_c3_e">Your effector unit tries to disable the enemy mind control device.</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_CE_PRE_FIGHT_EFFECTOR_1_c7_e_c4">Medbay.</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_CE_PRE_FIGHT_EFFECTOR_1_c7_e_c4_e">The enemy medical unit is disrupted.</text>

<text name="ce_eventList_CE_PRE_FIGHT_EFFECTOR_1_c7_e_c6">Door System.</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_CE_PRE_FIGHT_EFFECTOR_1_c7_e_c6_e">The enemy security system is breached. Fires can now spread easily and a boarding party can access the entire enemy ship.</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_CE_PRE_FIGHT_EFFECTOR_1_c7_e_c7">Life support.</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_CE_PRE_FIGHT_EFFECTOR_1_c7_e_c7_e">The effector disrupts parts of the enemy's oxygen distribution system.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_CE_PRE_FIGHT_MIND_SHIELD_TEXT_1">The mind shield scrambles any nearby brain wave emitters.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_CE_PRE_FIGHT_MIND_SHIELD_TEXT_2">The invisible anti mind control field can protect your crew against most control attempts. You engage the hostile.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_CE_PRE_FIGHT_MIND_SHIELD_TEXT_3">The special shielding prevents the enemy from using mind control devices effectively.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_CE_PRE_FIGHT_MIND_SHIELD_TEXT_4">You crew reports: "Brain wave jammers active, Captain. We are scrambling their controller devices."</text>
<text name="ce_textList_CE_PRE_FIGHT_MIND_SHIELD_TEXT_5">"Confirming Captain, we are now in brain-safe mode." You move in to engage.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_CE_PRE_FIGHT_MIND_SHIELD_TEXT_6">That should mess up your opponent's crazy tactics.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_CE_PRE_FIGHT_MIND_SHIELD_TEXT_7">The brain-wave jammer has trouble adjusting to the right frequency. But, after a while, you establish a stable mind shielding.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_CE_PRE_FIGHT_MIND_SHIELD_TEXT_8">Your augment once again tries to defend your crew against mind control attempts.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_CE_PRE_FIGHT_FIREWALL_TEXT_1">A few megawatts running through your hull plating should disrupt any hacker devices that get on your ship. The enemy hacking system will be rendered much less effective.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_CE_PRE_FIGHT_FIREWALL_TEXT_2">The real-space firewall is powered up. Their hacking attempts won't be very effective.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_CE_PRE_FIGHT_FIREWALL_TEXT_3">The crew feels a lot safer with this equipment active. The enemy will have a harder time messing with your ship's systems now.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_CE_PRE_FIGHT_FIREWALL_TEXT_4">The ultra hot firewall plating will obstruct enemy hacking drones from completely disrupting your ship.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_CE_PRE_FIGHT_FIREWALL_TEXT_5">You crew reports: "Firewalls heating up, Captain. We are physically protected against hacking devices."</text>
<text name="ce_textList_CE_PRE_FIGHT_FIREWALL_TEXT_6">"Confirming Captain, plating is going hot." You move in to engage.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_CE_PRE_FIGHT_FIREWALL_TEXT_7">Your augment will hamper your opponent's hacking attempts.</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_CE_PRE_FIGHT_EFFECTOR_RESULTS_WEAPONS_1_1">The enemy's weapon system is disrupted and they lose some system power.</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_CE_PRE_FIGHT_EFFECTOR_RESULTS_WEAPONS_1_2">The enemy's computer firewalls prove too advanced for your hacking device to circumvent.</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_CE_PRE_FIGHT_EFFECTOR_RESULTS_DRONES_1_1">The hacking attempt succeeds. The enemy's drone control loses system power.</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_CE_PRE_FIGHT_EFFECTOR_RESULTS_DRONES_1_3">The hacking attempt fails. The enemy remains in full control of all their drones.</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_CE_WEAPON_JAMMING_RESULTS_1_1">The enemy's weapons-targeting system must be obsolete. Your jammer proves quite effective!</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_CE_WEAPON_JAMMING_RESULTS_1_2">The jammer proves quite effective against this opponent. Some of its weapons can't be targeted manually and have to be left deactivated.</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_CE_WEAPON_JAMMING_RESULTS_1_3">The enemy targeting system is jammed and some of its guns power down automatically.</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_CE_WEAPON_JAMMING_RESULTS_1_4">Your jammer energizes and the enemy's weapons are partially scrambled.</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_CE_WEAPON_JAMMING_RESULTS_1_5">Your opponent surely didn't expect this. The enemy weapon-targeting fails, rendering some of its advanced armaments useless.</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_CE_WEAPON_JAMMING_RESULTS_1_6">The jammer succeeds in disrupting parts of the enemy's arsenal.</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_CE_WEAPON_JAMMING_RESULTS_1_7">Your crew reports, "Jammers active, Sir. Good effect on target."</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_CE_WEAPON_JAMMING_RESULTS_1_8">Your crew reports, "Jammers are active sir, but the enemy seems to be equipped with very advanced targeting systems. They still have a lock on us with their full weapons array." Not good...</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_CE_WEAPON_JAMMING_RESULTS_1_9">Your jamming augment seem to be useless against the more advanced targeting systems of this enemy. You will have to deal with the full fire from their weapons array.</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_CE_WEAPON_JAMMING_RESULTS_1_11">The enemy scanners should show nothing but static, but it seems you are still targeted with a full weapon cluster. The jammer proved ineffective here.</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_CE_DRONE_JAMMING_RESULTS_1_1">The enemy's drone status lights flicker and go out as their connection to the drone control is severed. One less problem to deal with.</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_CE_DRONE_JAMMING_RESULTS_1_2">Your crew reports, "Drone uplink disrupted, Captain."</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_CE_DRONE_JAMMING_RESULTS_1_3">The communications link between the enemy ship and its drones is seriously disrupted. Some of the drones shut down completely.</text>

<text name="ce_eventList_CE_COMBAT_FLUFF_MANNED_29">"Captain, it appears we are leaking atmosphere." The battle strained the ship a little too much. Parts of the inner and outer sealing have been compromised and the explosive decompression breaches the ship hull.</text>

<text name="ce_eventList_CE_COMBAT_FLUFF_MANNED_REBEL_31">In the mids of battle, an escape pod detaches from the enemy ship. The pod is badly damaged and it starts to emit a distress signal with Federation encoding. Faint life-signs are detected from within.</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_CE_COMBAT_FLUFF_MANNED_REBEL_31_c1">Maybe a prisoner? Approach the pod to pick it up.</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_CE_COMBAT_FLUFF_MANNED_REBEL_31_c2">Better don't take any risks. Ignore the pod.</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_CE_COMBAT_FLUFF_MANNED_REBEL_31_c2_e">As the battle progresses, you scanners soon loose track of the pod as its autonomous energy source ceases to function. If anyone was in there, he is probably dead now.</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_CE_REBEL_ESCAPE_POD_1">You quickly pick up the pod in fly-by. It indeed contains a Federation officer who managed to escape the Rebels captivity in the heat of battle. You remind him that the fight isn't over yet and throw him a com-piece. "Understood. Reporting for duty, Captain."</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_CE_REBEL_ESCAPE_POD_2">You pick up the pod in fly-by and watch the cam feed as your crew quickly proceeds to open it. They find nothing but a whining Castovian Moon-Puppy, alongside several pounds of firebombs with their timer approaching zero. One of your crew fails to escape the blast. Damn those Rebels!</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_CE_REBEL_TURNCOAT_JOIN_1">You dock with the Rebel cruft, but immediately realize that this offer was ruse. A concealed detachment of Rebel marines breaches your shield room and escapes deeper into the ship before you can call for a lockdown. The Rebel craft breaks away from you and re-opens fire.</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_CE_REBEL_TURNCOAT_JOIN_2">The turncoat cannot believe his luck. Better keep a close eye on them. You leave the Rebel ship to his remaining crew, they hope to flee the fleet's advance and return to their homes.</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_CE_REBEL_TURNCOAT_PRISONER_2">You contact a local Rebel official via an encrypted proxy beacon and fix a rendezvous point in neutral territory to perform a prisoner exchange. If you can get there before the fleet then you might be able to negotiate the release of the prisoners under favorable conditions.</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_CE_COMBAT_FLUFF_MANNED_AMMO_1">The ammo was rigged with detonators and explodes as your ship gets near. You can't believe you fell for this.</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_CE_COMBAT_FLUFF_MANNED_AMMO_2">You extract the recovery arms and grab the ammo in fly by. If your ship is equipped with compatible launchers, you could even fire it at your enemy now.</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_CE_COMBAT_FLUFF_MANNED_FUEL_1">When you approach the fuel, your opponent turns hard and fires a potshot at the containers. Thy burst into blue flames that wash right over your ship. Your opponent must be pretty desperate to attempt something like this.</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_CE_COMBAT_FLUFF_MANNED_FUEL_2">You extract the recovery arms and grab the fuel in fly-by.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_CE_COMBAT_FLUFF_MANNED_TEXT_1">During a fly-by, you catch a glimpse of the enemy captain through his ship's main view-port. For a split second you come face to face with your enemy.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_CE_COMBAT_FLUFF_MANNED_TEXT_2">Your shots pierce through the enemy craft, spilling trails of molten metal into open space. The enemy is taking heavy damage.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_CE_COMBAT_FLUFF_MANNED_TEXT_3">The constant maneuvering almost throws you out of your seat. Steady now!</text>
<text name="ce_textList_CE_COMBAT_FLUFF_MANNED_TEXT_4">All of the sudden the opponent turns and boosts into your direction; you barely manage to avoid a collision. This definitely caught you off guard. The maneuver was either very well planned or completely mad.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_CE_COMBAT_FLUFF_MANNED_TEXT_5">While your weapons trace the enemy, the ship briefly passes in front of the systems sun. For a split-second, it appears as a majestically illuminated shadow in front of the giant star. A brief image of beauty during the cruel carnage of ship-to-ship combat.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_CE_COMBAT_FLUFF_MANNED_TEXT_6">"Enemy structural integrity is failing, Captain. We got this!"</text>
<text name="ce_textList_CE_COMBAT_FLUFF_MANNED_TEXT_7">"Shots continue to connect, Captain. Good effect on target."</text>
<text name="ce_textList_CE_COMBAT_FLUFF_MANNED_TEXT_8">"Where did he go?" "I can't track him, there is some interference." "There, eighty degrees to the relative right." "OK, re-engaging." Your crew desperately tries to keep on target.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_CE_COMBAT_FLUFF_MANNED_TEXT_9">Your opponent hails: "Give up, you can't win this!"</text>
<text name="ce_textList_CE_COMBAT_FLUFF_MANNED_TEXT_10">Your opponent hails: "We will crush you!"</text>

<text name="ce_textList_CE_COMBAT_FLUFF_MANNED_TEXT_13">Your opponent hails, but the transmission is completely garbled.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_CE_COMBAT_FLUFF_MANNED_TEXT_14">Your opponent hails, but the transmission is interrupted by the hits the enemy sustains. You decide to pay this no mind and focus on keeping a lock on the enemy.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_CE_COMBAT_FLUFF_MANNED_TEXT_15">Suddenly electricity arcs out of your console. "Isolate this coupler and reroute my command to another station."</text>
<text name="ce_textList_CE_COMBAT_FLUFF_MANNED_TEXT_16">As your ships exchange fire, your opponent starts to send one insulting hail after another. You decide to ignore this and focus on the combat at hand.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_CE_COMBAT_FLUFF_MANNED_TEXT_17">You remember this maneuver from the academy! Did your opponent at some point receive training from the Federation?</text>
<text name="ce_textList_CE_COMBAT_FLUFF_MANNED_TEXT_18">You never saw the maneuvers your opponent is flying, but they are not without style. The enemy Captain must have been trained in some remote alien flight school.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_CE_COMBAT_FLUFF_MANNED_TEXT_19">The enemy craft seemed to have had some additional passengers aboard. Escape pods are jettisoned from the craft and tumble far away into open space. The enemy starts to abandon ship.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_CE_COMBAT_FLUFF_MANNED_TEXT_20">The dampeners run on full as you maneuver and exchange fire with your enemy. The heat aboard the ship becomes almost unbearable.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_CE_COMBAT_FLUFF_MANNED_TEXT_21">You stand in front of the captain's chair, focused on the windscreen, bellowing orders to your crew. You will not let this opponent get the better of you!</text>
<text name="ce_textList_CE_COMBAT_FLUFF_MANNED_TEXT_22">Just after you bellowed this last order, everything becomes still for a second. You see yourself from the outside, clutched to one of the silver railings that lines the ship bridge, shouting orders, gesticulating at the screen... Then you remember your parents, your childhood, your time at the academy, the line of cause and effect that brought you here; to another fight to the death. What has become of you?</text>
<text name="ce_textList_CE_COMBAT_FLUFF_MANNED_TEXT_23">Hold it steady and stay on target... Just like in the simulations.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_CE_COMBAT_FLUFF_MANNED_TEXT_24">You will defeat this enemy, just like the ones you defeated before. For the Federation! Your father would be proud.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_CE_COMBAT_FLUFF_MANNED_TEXT_25">You are determined to not let this opponent get the upper hand. "Fire when ready!"</text>
<text name="ce_textList_CE_COMBAT_FLUFF_MANNED_TEXT_26">The combat noticeably strains the ship. Sparks fly from sealing panels and acrid smoke covers the floor. You smell burnt plastic and your own sweat.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_CE_COMBAT_FLUFF_MANNED_TEXT_27">For a moment you are afraid of losing it. What if we don't make it? What if we can't escape or defeat the next enemy? You don't want to die! Then it passes... The crew does not seem to have noticed, or at least isn't showing it. You take a deep breath and re-collect yourself, then you ask for a situation report and try to focus on the battle.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_CE_COMBAT_FLUFF_MANNED_TEXT_28">The ship's hull creaks under the stress of the combat maneuvers. You hope the ship can take it.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_CE_COMBAT_FLUFF_MANNED_TEXT_29">Your fire tears away a huge section of the enemy plating. Good hit!</text>
<text name="ce_textList_CE_COMBAT_FLUFF_MANNED_TEXT_30">Hull plating is scattered into space as your shots impact on the enemy craft. You'll pick those up later.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_CE_COMBAT_FLUFF_MANNED_TEXT_31">Your opponent's hull is covered with glowing impact craters of various sizes. They won't be able to take this kind of punishment much longer.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_CE_COMBAT_FLUFF_MANNED_TEXT_32">You are hailed: "Hey, Captain, should we call it a draw? Ha, just kidding! Bring it on!"</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_CE_COMBAT_FLUFF_AUTO_12">The enemy's engines begin to stutter. The AI craft navigated too hard and burned out the stabilizers.</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_CE_COMBAT_FLUFF_AUTO_14">During fly-by, the automated craft suddenly launches a micro missile from a hidden compartment in its head section. The projectile pierces your shields and hull, but instead of detonating deploys a holo-generation unit inside your ship. A crude holographic representation of the auto crafts combat AI is spawned inside your ship and assaults your crew.</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_CE_COMBAT_FLUFF_AUTO_15">The fighting maneuvers bring your ships close to a small asteroid field. The automated craft activates its backup thrusters and speeds towards the rocks. It tries to lose you in the hazard zone, and will surely inform the Rebel fleet about your wherabouts if it gets away.</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_CE_COMBAT_FLUFF_AUTO_15_c1">Go after the ship.</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_CE_COMBAT_FLUFF_AUTO_15_c1_e">You order evasive maneuvers and follow the craft into the asteroids.</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_CE_COMBAT_FLUFF_AUTO_15_c2">Let it escape.</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_CE_COMBAT_FLUFF_AUTO_17">The ship computer reports: "Warning! Decompression event imminent on main deck." The battle strained the ship a little too much. Parts of the inner and outer sealing have been compromised and you are losing atmosphere through a breached hull section.</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_CE_COMBAT_FLUFF_AUTO_ASTEROIDS_1">The ship maneuvers the hazardous terrain with ease and disappears into the field. It will certainly report back to the fleet soon.</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_CE_COMBAT_FLUFF_AUTO_ASTEROIDS_2">The automated craft escapes into the asteroid field, but its simple AI is unable to cope with the hazardous environment. Before you get a chance to intercept the craft, a large asteroid does your work for you and crushes into the craft's mid-section. You move in to salvage from the disabled ship.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_CE_COMBAT_FLUFF_AUTO_TEXT_3">All of the sudden, the small auto ship turns and boosts into your direction; you barely manage to avoid a collision. This definitely caught you off guard.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_CE_COMBAT_FLUFF_AUTO_TEXT_4">While your weapons trace the enemy, the ship briefly passes in front of the system's sun. For a split-second, it appears as a majestically illuminated shadow in front of the giant star, a brief image of beauty during the cruel carnage of ship-to-ship combat.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_CE_COMBAT_FLUFF_AUTO_TEXT_9">The automated craft starts to continuously message you: "DIEDIEDIEDIEDIEDIEDIEDIEDIEDIEDIEDIEDIEDIEDIEDIE"</text>
<text name="ce_textList_CE_COMBAT_FLUFF_AUTO_TEXT_10">The AI craft hails you: "This is an automated message. Resisting our takeover is pointless. Prepare to die." You've heard it all before.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_CE_COMBAT_FLUFF_AUTO_TEXT_11">The AI craft sends its mantra again: "This is an automated message. Resisting our takeover is pointless. Prepare to die."</text>
<text name="ce_textList_CE_COMBAT_FLUFF_AUTO_TEXT_12">The AI craft sends a threatening message. You order to block its channels and focus on the battle.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_CE_COMBAT_FLUFF_AUTO_TEXT_13">The AI craft hails you: "This is an automated message. You have resisted an executive unit of the Rebellion. This violation has been filed and will have consequences regardless of the outcome of this engagement."</text>

<text name="ce_event_QUEST_MANTIS_INVASION">You find the Mantis encampment but there are far too many of them to count accurately. You send a long-range message back to the settlement with your findings but unfortunately there's not much you can do. It would be suicide to attack directly.</text>
<text name="ce_event_QUEST_MANTIS_INVASION_c1_e">You fire at their fuel depot, but a shot from the surface rips the missile to shreds. Their planetary defense system is already fully operational! You try to get away but a nearby defense ship moves in to attack.</text>

<text name="ce_event_QUEST_MANTIS_INVASION_c2_e">The drone quietly floats deep into the camp. Once in position, it fires its entire payload into the Mantis munition depot. The drone cam goes dark and a bright flash fills the vidscreen as the depot explodes. Mantis ships scatter away in all directions.</text>
<text name="ce_event_QUEST_MANTIS_INVASION_c2_e_c1_e">With most of their ships fleeing or focused on the chaos, you slip undetected into a nearby hangar. You find some useful resources.</text>
<text name="ce_event_QUEST_MANTIS_INVASION_c3_e">It appears they have not set up a teleporter disruption field yet. You deposit one bomb in a fuel depot and another in the barracks. Mantis comm channels fill with panicked chatter and you watch a number of structures go up in flames.</text>
<text name="ce_event_QUEST_MANTIS_INVASION_c4">(Minelauncher) Place some mines in their jump corridor. [ Missiles: -3 ]</text>
<text name="ce_event_QUEST_MANTIS_INVASION_c4_e">You lay low and drop some mines around the beacon, then you get the ship in a suitable ambush position. After only little time, a Mantis supply convoy jumps in. The mines detonate between the not yet fully materialized ships, tearing their particle fabric apart and destroying them in sub- and real-space alike.</text>
<text name="ce_event_QUEST_MANTIS_INVASION_c4_e_c1_e">You sweep in to finish any stragglers and make of with the spoils before the guard ships arrive.</text>

<text name="ce_eventList_ALISON_DEFECTOR_SLUG_2">Your slug stares at the Rebel for moment. "Don't trussst them ssir, they want to deceive you!" As you order to restrain the intruder, things escalate. Attempting to deal with attacks from inside and out is never easy!</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_ALISON_DEFECTOR_SLUG_3">Your slug stares at the Rebel for moment. "Thiss persson indeed wantss to defect from the Rebel fleet." The Slug crew member speaks. "They have ssseen terrible, terrible thingss there, but they have a strong mind. They will be a valuable addition to your crew." A little disturbed by the telepathic intrusion, your new crew member gets to work as the Rebel ship attacks.</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_ALISON_DEFECTOR_SLUG_4">Your slug stares at the Rebel for moment. "Thiss persson indeed wantss to defect from the Rebel fleet." The defector complains, "Did you just mess with my mind? I wanted to escape this kind of repression, but the Federation seems to have no respect for individual rights either..."</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_ALISON_DEFECTOR_SLUG_4_c1_e">"I won't submit to your command. You can take me as a prisoner." He refuses to say another word. You probably can leave him at the next station, but you will have to deal with the Rebel ship he escaped from first.</text>

<text name="ce_eventList_DEAD_CREW_SLAVER_1">You find a number of slaves in the cargo hold. They look at you questioningly and one asks if they're to be released. You could use more crew but you don't really want to force them to work for you. Fortunately some of them offer to join your crew as thanks for the rescue.</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_DEAD_CREW_SLAVER_1_c1">Release all the slaves.</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_DEAD_CREW_SLAVER_1_c1_e">The slaves stare at you with disbelief when you inform them that they are free now, but then each of them displays great gratitude. The Engi thanks you personally, "Adherence to general system law by Federation personal, rare at current period." You drop them off at a nearby station.</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_DEAD_CREW_SLAVER_1_c2">Let the Mantis join your crew and release the rest.</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_DEAD_CREW_SLAVER_1_c2_e">The Mantis seems fine with the orders, saying "I'm on board if it means we kill some Rebels!" You drop the rest off at a nearby station.</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_DEAD_CREW_SLAVER_1_c3">Let the Rockman join your crew and release the rest.</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_DEAD_CREW_SLAVER_1_c3_e">The Rockman remains silent and you worry there might be trouble. However when you ask them to perform a task they act without complaint. Perhaps they won't be a problem.</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_DEAD_CREW_SLAVER_1_c4">Let the Engi join your crew and release the rest.</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_DEAD_CREW_SLAVER_1_c4_e">"Verify primary object is to defeat Rebels, re-establish peace?" You nod and it responds, "Acceptable." You drop the rest off at a nearby station after stripping the ship.</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_DEAD_CREW_SLAVER_2">It appears the slaves did not survive the fighting, you find their burnt bodies in the hold, but before you strip the ship you hear faint noises in the walls. You break off a latch and a slave falls out of a hidden compartment, coughing. Once recomposed, the slave wonders what their fate will be.</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_DEAD_CREW_SLAVER_2_c1">Free the slave and drop them off at the next station.</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_DEAD_CREW_SLAVER_2_c2">Force the slave to work on board your ship.</text>
<text name="ce_event_PIRATE_SURRENDER_c1_e_c1">Honor your truce and let the enemy leave.</text>
<text name="ce_event_PIRATE_SURRENDER_c1_e_c2">Open fire on your defeated opponent.</text>
<text name="ce_event_PIRATE_SURRENDER_c2">(Zoltan Ship) You command a ship of the wise and diplomatic Zoltan. This has to be done the right way: negotiating the surrender in accordance with general system law.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_CE_SURRENDER_RESULTS_TEXT_1">You open the airlocks and take the reparation supplies aboard. Your opponent is glad to still be alive.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_CE_SURRENDER_RESULTS_TEXT_2">The exchange of goods goes without problems.</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_CE_SURRENDER_SHIP_ATTACK_1">It took some time to transfer the goods. The opponent's FTL is already charged and they begin to jump. A wise decision.</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_CE_SURRENDER_SHIP_ATTACK_2">Your opponent is scared like a Slug in open space. After dropping the agreed amount of supplies, they immediately put as much distance between your two ships as possible. They are already out of weapon range.</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_CE_SURRENDER_SHIP_ATTACK_3">Your opponent is heavily damaged, but they have called for backup during the fight and several ship already circle the beacon. This won't work, you have to get out of here.</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_CE_SURRENDER_SHIP_ATTACK_4">Your opponent is terrified. "What? Please, you can't do this!" You cut the transmission and order an attack course.</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_CE_SURRENDER_SHIP_ATTACK_5">The defeated captain informs you that you commit a direct violation of the galactic rules of engagement. The ship also charges weapons again.</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_CE_SURRENDER_SHIP_ATTACK_6">"We gave you all we had!" It was not enough...</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_CE_SURRENDER_SHIP_ATTACK_7">Your opponent did not anticipate this deception. They try to get away, but you will catch up with them shortly.</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_CE_SURRENDER_SHIP_ATTACK_8">No one that attacks a proud Federation vessel should be allowed to get away with it! You decide that your opponent has to die.</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_CE_SURRENDER_STATION_ATTACK_1">The station can barely maintain it's structural integrity. But during the time in takes to transfer the goods, several armed ships have arrived following your opponent's distress call.</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_CE_SURRENDER_STATION_ATTACK_3">The defeated station chief informs you that you commit a direct violation of the galactic rules of engagement. The stations weapons have barely cooled down.</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_CE_SURRENDER_STATION_ATTACK_4">The enemy station is heavily damaged and it's not like they could escape somehow... This is just too tempting.</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_CE_SURRENDER_STATION_ATTACK_5">Your opponent are anticipating that you might engage them again. Their weapons are still pointed at you.</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_CE_SURRENDER_BETRAYAL_1">Denying a surrender is already seen as pretty barbaric. But deceiving people into giving up valuable supplies and then opening fire on the already defeated oponent violates even the lax rules of the Federation. This course of action might disturb the crew.</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_CE_SURRENDER_BETRAYAL_1_c1">See how the crew reacts.</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_CE_SURRENDER_BETRAYAL_1_c2">(Slug Ship) You command a vessel of the sly and treacherous Slugs. Your crew knew this mission wouldn't go entirely by the book.</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_CE_SURRENDER_BETRAYAL_1_c2_e">Desperate times call for desperate measures, and rules were made to be broken, no? Your crew agrees that sometimes individual lives mean nothing. We need to get to the Federation base at any cost and we need any resources we can get.</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_CE_SURRENDER_BETRAYAL_RESULTS_1">That clearly violates Federation protocol, but you decide that ends justify the means. If you don't make it to the main base there simply won't be any Federation left to make up rules. Your crew is quite disturbed by all this.</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_CE_SURRENDER_BETRAYAL_RESULTS_2">That clearly violates Federation protocol, but some of your crew agree that your opponent does not deserve better.</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_CE_SURRENDER_BETRAYAL_RESULTS_3">The lives of millions depend on this mission, and you need any scrap you can get. Your crew doesn't seem to see it exactly like that, but they follow their orders.</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_CE_SURRENDER_BETRAYAL_RESULTS_4">Your crew recommends you should stick to the rules. "Captain, with all due respect, maybe we are the ones who will have to surrender one day. We would expect our opponent to obey the rules of engagement as well."</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_CE_SURRENDER_BETRAYAL_RESULTS_5">Your crewmen discuss it with each other and decide not to execute the attack order. They suggest you think again about what you are actually fighting for here. This behavior amounts to mutiny, but there's not much you can do about it.</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_CE_SURRENDER_BETRAYAL_RESULTS_5_c2">(Anti-Personnel Drone) Have your battle drone execute the mutiny leader.</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_CE_SURRENDER_BETRAYAL_RESULTS_5_c2_e">You have a vague idea who is behind this insubordination and override your battle drone's safety protocols. The crew is quite surprised when it rolls up on the bridge, and indeed shocked when your crewman is riddled with laser fire from the drone's blasters.</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_CE_SURRENDER_BETRAYAL_RESULTS_5_c2_e_clone">You purge the traitor's DNA from the clone bay's database. Traitors don't get a second chance on your ship.</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_CE_SURRENDER_BETRAYAL_RESULTS_5_c2_e_c2_e">This was drastic, but you won't let any individuals endanger your mission. Discipline has to be preserved. Everyone would have done the same in this situation. You are a perfectly sane ship's Captain after all, right? You decide to keep the drone at your side for security reasons and repeat your orders. This time the crew complies.</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_CE_SURRENDER_BETRAYAL_RESULTS_6">Most of your crew has no problem with finishing the ship off. But one crewman sends in a formal complaint. "I have seen enough Captain, this is not what I signed up for." The crewman deserts your ship in a shuttle, planing to join the independent militia in the Civilian Coreworlds.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_CE_SURRENDER_NEGOTIATION_RESULTS_TEXT_1">The negations are conducted in accordance with the general rules of engagement. Your opponent's dignity is preserved and you come to a favorable truce.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_CE_SURRENDER_NEGOTIATION_RESULTS_TEXT_2">You suggest that you have both won. The opposing captain agrees immediately, probably fearing future legal prosecution by the Zoltan authorities.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_CE_SURRENDER_NEGOTIATION_RESULTS_TEXT_3">You point out that both sides have proven their worth in combat and offer an exchange of goods. You has little choice but to agree.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_CE_SURRENDER_NEGOTIATION_RESULTS_TEXT_4">You agree that this was all a misunderstanding and ask if you can further help you former opponent. They decline and willingly transmit supplies, knowing that violating the rules might get them in trouble with the Zoltan later.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_CE_SURRENDER_NEGOTIATION_RESULTS_TEXT_5">You immediately power down the weapons to show your good will. A deal favorable for both factions is struck in order to compensate for the damage that was done.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_CE_SURRENDER_NEGOTIATION_RESULTS_TEXT_6">Seems comms are sometimes still mightier than weapons. You reach a favorable agreement.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_CE_SURRENDER_NEGOTIATION_RESULTS_TEXT_7">Your opponent has to compensate you for the damage done. So says the law.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_CE_SURRENDER_NEGOTIATION_RESULTS_TEXT_8">Exchange of weapon fire is followed by an exchange of goods. You are glad that this did not have to end in further bloodshed.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_CE_SURRENDER_NEGOTIATION_RESULTS_TEXT_9">For once, diplomacy prevails. Maybe peace still has a chance in this galaxy?</text>
<text name="ce_textList_CE_SURRENDER_NEGOTIATION_RESULTS_TEXT_10">Your opponent agrees to all conditions. It seems they have some respect for Zoltan authority.</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_CE_PEACE_NEGOTIATION_RESULTS_1">Surprisingly, your opponent is ready to listen. They agree that there is way to much fighting going on in this galaxy. They themselves have lost friends and relatives in the conflict. "We long realized that revenge is leading nowhere." They even offer some supplies for your journey. "Use it for good."</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_CE_PEACE_NEGOTIATION_RESULTS_2">"Wait, no markings... are you with the actual Zoltan peace synod?" They offer their apologies. "Tough times, you know... we really did not want to..." Your opponent eagerly offers some supplies to appease you. Seems good old Zoltan authority mixed with some smiling is still good to intimidate some people.</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_CE_PEACE_NEGOTIATION_RESULTS_7">You decide to go through with this. The crew cuts the engines and drop the shields. Your opponent opens fire and a full volley hits your ship. "You really won't fight back? Alright we are sorry, you can pass." You are not sure what is going on here but is seems you are free to jump onwards.</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_CE_PEACE_NEGOTIATION_RESULTS_8">You hail the opponent repeatedly, but get no answer. Sensors show a slight increase in their weapon power levels. Diplomacy has failed, you will have to fight.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_CE_PEACE_NEGOTIATION_RESULTS_TEXT_1">You decide to go through with this. The crew cuts the engines and drop the shields. Your opponent seems unwilling to open fire on a defenseless target. No further words are exchanged till you jump away.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_CE_PEACE_NEGOTIATION_RESULTS_TEXT_2">"We see. Your ship represents values we thought had been long lost." They let you go.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_CE_PEACE_NEGOTIATION_RESULTS_TEXT_3">Your opponent seems surprised that you do not get the ship combat ready. They keep the channel open and you are able to talk them into letting you go. They realize that another engagement here would only lead to even more problems for everyone.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_CE_PEACE_NEGOTIATION_RESULTS_TEXT_4">Your crew gives quite a speech. They remind everyone of the impeding doom that the Rebel fleet brings and ask to remain civilized here.</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_CE_PLAYER_SURRENDER_ZOLTAN_1_c1_e">You consider how many supplies you can offer as bounty. The Zoltan will most likely accept any surrender, as long as it does not violate the general rules of space combat.</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_CE_PLAYER_SURRENDER_ZOLTAN_1_c1_e_c1">Make a minimal offer in accordance with general system law. [ Fuel: -2; Drone Parts: -1; Scrap: -15 ]</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_CE_PLAYER_SURRENDER_ZOLTAN_1_c1_e_c2">Change your mind and prepare to fight.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_CE_PLAYER_SURRENDER_ZOLTAN_TEXT_1">The Zoltan stand down and hails: "Splendid! We'd have it no other way. May our negations be fruitful!"</text>
<text name="ce_textList_CE_PLAYER_SURRENDER_ZOLTAN_TEXT_2">The Zoltan stand down and hails: "You demonstrate an usually amount of thoughtfulness here. We will let you go if you offer a surrender in in accordance with general system law."</text>
<text name="ce_textList_CE_PLAYER_SURRENDER_ZOLTAN_TEXT_3">Communications report that the Zoltan are answering you hail. The captain appears on screen and says, "Yes, you could not have withstand us anyway. Make you offer and we will settle with reporting you. Then leave this place immediately."</text>
<text name="ce_textList_CE_PLAYER_SURRENDER_ZOLTAN_TEXT_4">"You are right. This does not have to end in meaningless violence." The Zoltan suggest negotiating a fair surrender.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_CE_PLAYER_SURRENDER_ZOLTAN_TEXT_5">"Of course you will surrender. You could never withstand the enlightened, even in such a mondane thing as ship-to-ship combat." You will have to swallow your pride here and talk this through.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_CE_PLAYER_SURRENDER_ZOLTAN_TEXT_6">The Zoltan open a channel. You put up a show and beg for your life.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_CE_PLAYER_SURRENDER_ZOLTAN_TEXT_7">You open a channel and accuse the Zoltan of displaying an uncivilized amount of aggression. That hit the spot. Their ship is standing down.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_CE_PLAYER_SURRENDER_ZOLTAN_TEXT_8">You tell them that they this is all a misunderstanding. Let's hope they accept your price.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_CE_PLAYER_SURRENDER_ZOLTAN_TEXT_9">You tell the Zoltan that they you will not fight back. You know that their moral codes will not allow them to refuse surrender. They will take any offer you make, but will report you to the local authorities.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_CE_PLAYER_SURRENDER_ZOLTAN_SUCCESS_TEXT_1">Most Zoltan would never open fire on an opponent that has surrendered. As expected, they accept your offer.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_CE_PLAYER_SURRENDER_ZOLTAN_SUCCESS_TEXT_2">The ship computer clears the targeting warning and the enemy craft flags itself as neutral. Seems you where able to buy yourself out of this.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_CE_PLAYER_SURRENDER_ZOLTAN_SUCCESS_TEXT_3">You know that, by law, the Zoltan have to accept the offer. "We are not authorized to apprehend you for your transgression ourselves. You are free to go. But be assured, this is not over yet. We will report this."</text>
<text name="ce_textList_CE_PLAYER_SURRENDER_ZOLTAN_SUCCESS_TEXT_4">"We are glad to have come to a peaceful resolution. Now get out of here."</text>
<text name="ce_textList_CE_PLAYER_SURRENDER_ZOLTAN_SUCCESS_TEXT_5">It turns out the Zoltan are eager to accept. In fact, they are almost embarrassed that this incident escalated so quickly.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_CE_PLAYER_SURRENDER_ZOLTAN_SUCCESS_TEXT_6">"This transfer of material goods is merely symbolic. We hope you will learn to stay out of trouble in the future. Peace with you."</text>
<text name="ce_textList_CE_PLAYER_SURRENDER_ZOLTAN_SUCCESS_TEXT_7">The Zoltan captain hails and mutters something about the border patrol force catching up with you someday. Seems they are barely interested in your offer, but have to accept it anyway, because of their laws.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_CE_PLAYER_SURRENDER_ROCK_TEXT_1">The Rock ship ceases fire and answers your hail: "State your offer, foreigners."</text>
<text name="ce_textList_CE_PLAYER_SURRENDER_ROCK_TEXT_2">The Rock ship stands down and hails. "Do you want to pay? Good!"</text>
<text name="ce_textList_CE_PLAYER_SURRENDER_ROCK_TEXT_3">The Rock take great pride in having defeated you. "The foreign invaders tremble under the might of the Rock kingdoms! Make your offer and we shall decide if we let you live."</text>
<text name="ce_textList_CE_PLAYER_SURRENDER_ROCK_TEXT_4">"You admit defeat? A wise captain would rather die." The Rock captain on screen continues to mock you. Let's hope they'll let you go if you transmit a big enough price.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_CE_PLAYER_SURRENDER_ROCK_TEXT_5">"You have been bested. Honor demands that you make a suitable offer in scrap now. So are our ways."</text>
<text name="ce_textList_CE_PLAYER_SURRENDER_ROCK_TEXT_6">The Rock open a channel. You put up a show and beg for your life.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_CE_PLAYER_SURRENDER_ROCK_TEXT_7">For a change it's you who is begging for their life. The Rock are willing to listen.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_CE_PLAYER_SURRENDER_ROCK_TEXT_8">You tell them that they are "considerably more well-armed than you would have thought." Let's hope they accept your price.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_CE_PLAYER_SURRENDER_ROCK_TEXT_9">They Rock are willing to negotiate the exact conditions of your surrender. You can not be sure that they will accept your offer. But at last they usually honor the truce if a surrender has been accepted.</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_CE_PLAYER_SURRENDER_PIRATE_5_c1_e">You consider how many supplies you can offer as bounty. Will your opponent be satisfied and accept your surrender?</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_CE_PLAYER_SURRENDER_PIRATE_5_c1_e_c1">Make a bad offer. [ Fuel: -2; Missiles: -1; Scrap: -15 ]</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_CE_PLAYER_SURRENDER_PIRATE_5_c1_e_c2">Make a good offer. [ Fuel: -4; Missiles: -2; Drone Parts: -1; Scrap: -25 ]</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_CE_PLAYER_SURRENDER_PIRATE_5_c1_e_c3">Make a great offer. [ Fuel: -5; Missiles: -3; Drone Parts: -2; Scrap: -35 ]</text>
<text name="ce_textList_CE_PLAYER_SURRENDER_PIRATE_TEXT_1">The Pirate ship ceases fire and answers your hail: "Interesting. What do you offer?"</text>
<text name="ce_textList_CE_PLAYER_SURRENDER_PIRATE_TEXT_2">The Pirate ship stands down and hails. "Good decision. Let's see what you got."</text>
<text name="ce_textList_CE_PLAYER_SURRENDER_PIRATE_TEXT_3">The Pirates are relieved when you put up you white flag tags. Seems they where barely willing to take on a cruiser.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_CE_PLAYER_SURRENDER_PIRATE_TEXT_4">"Nice! OK, you know the drill, make your offer." The pirates claim that they will follow the rules. They'll let you go if you transmit a big enough price.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_CE_PLAYER_SURRENDER_PIRATE_TEXT_5">"Of course you will surrender. We are among the most dreaded pirates in the galaxy. Now let's talk business."</text>
<text name="ce_textList_CE_PLAYER_SURRENDER_PIRATE_TEXT_6">The Pirates open a channel. You put up a show and beg for your life.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_CE_PLAYER_SURRENDER_PIRATE_TEXT_7">For a change it's you who is begging for their life. The Pirates are willing to listen.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_CE_PLAYER_SURRENDER_PIRATE_TEXT_9">You tell the pirates that they have already won. They are willing to negotiate the exact conditions of your surrender.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_CE_PLAYER_SURRENDER_PIRATE_BETRAYAL_TEXT_1">You transmit the supplies and the Pirates contact you again: "Really, I can't believe you'd fall for this. We will sell the wreckage of your ship to the Rebels for even more scrap."</text>
<text name="ce_textList_CE_PLAYER_SURRENDER_PIRATE_BETRAYAL_TEXT_2">The Pirates take the supplies on board but remain in position. Something is not right here. Weapons lock detected! You should not have trusted these outlaws.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_CE_PLAYER_SURRENDER_PIRATE_BETRAYAL_TEXT_3">Galactic conduct has declined since the Rebellion. These Pirates don't even obey the most basic rules of combat anymore. They take your price money and then engage you anyway.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_CE_PLAYER_SURRENDER_SLUG_TEXT_1">The Slug ship ceases fire and answers your hail: "Interesssting. What do you offer?"</text>
<text name="ce_textList_CE_PLAYER_SURRENDER_SLUG_TEXT_2">The Slug ship stands down and hails. "Profit! You better make uss a good offer or we will desstroy you!"</text>
<text name="ce_textList_CE_PLAYER_SURRENDER_SLUG_TEXT_3">Not all Slug are greedy, but these certainly are. They are willing to accept surrender, as long as it is more profitable to them than destroying your ship.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_CE_PLAYER_SURRENDER_SLUG_TEXT_4">"I sssense that you are sserious. Alright, think about something we could need."</text>
<text name="ce_textList_CE_PLAYER_SURRENDER_SLUG_FAIL_TEXT_1">You transmit the supplies and the Slugs contact you again: "Ssserioussly? Why in a cloud would you assume that we would be ssatissfied with this? We know that there iss much more to gain from your ssship. We will take all!"</text>
<text name="ce_textList_CE_PLAYER_SURRENDER_SLUG_FAIL_TEXT_2">The Slug take the supplies on board and leave. You engage the jump charge but the Slug ship turns and approaches on a direct attack course. They must have had a change of heart, you have been betrayed.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_CE_PLAYER_SURRENDER_SLUG_FAIL_TEXT_3">Some Slugs captains don't even care about the galactic rules of engagement anymore. The Slug take your price money and then engage you anyway.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_CE_PLAYER_SURRENDER_SLUG_FAIL_TEXT_4">"Thank you. We take the resst from your wreckage." The Slug move in to attack? This is outrageous, a direct violation of galactic conduct. Let's hope you survive to report this.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_CE_PLAYER_SURRENDER_SUCCESS_SLUG_TEXT_1">The Slugs are elated to profit from you so easily. "A very good decision. We could have annihilated you, but this way we all get out of this richer. You also gained something here: experience. We hope you will realize that this is much more valuable than the materials your will transfer. Hehe."</text>
<text name="ce_textList_CE_PLAYER_SURRENDER_SUCCESS_SLUG_TEXT_2">The Slug cuts you of before can even properly state you offer. "Yes yes I know. Just hand it over."</text>
<text name="ce_textList_CE_PLAYER_SURRENDER_SUCCESS_SLUG_TEXT_3">The Slug ship keeps you targeted while you transmit the supplies. They then continue to circle your cruiser. Looks like they not sure if they really want to let you go. You are glad when you hear the familiar drive charge sound. Let's get out of here!</text>
<text name="ce_textList_CE_PLAYER_SURRENDER_SUCCESS_SLUG_TEXT_4">"A pleasssure doing bussinesss with you."</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_CE_PLAYER_SURRENDER_MANTIS_4">The Mantis immediately teleport a squadron of warriors aboard. The leader approaches you, bringing his head up right in front of your face. Acid dripping from his mouth, he says: "Yes yes, they always want to surrender. We will take one of your crew as a slave. Hand one over!"</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_CE_PLAYER_SURRENDER_MANTIS_4_c1">We have to get out of this somehow. Draw straws...</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_CE_PLAYER_SURRENDER_MANTIS_4_c1_e">Naturally, your whole crew is not exactly at ease with this whole deal. "I understand, Captain. Goodbye." Your crewman salutes a last time before being teleported away together with the Mantis warriors.</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_CE_PLAYER_SURRENDER_MANTIS_4_c2">Refuse to give up one of your crew.</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_CE_PLAYER_SURRENDER_MANTIS_4_c2_e">"What? You pathetic little alien. Then you all die!" The warriors brandish their claws and attack with ferocious screams.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_CE_PLAYER_SURRENDER_MANTIS_TEXT_1">The Mantis cease fire and answers your hail: "You are weak! Send a good bounty or you all die!"</text>
<text name="ce_textList_CE_PLAYER_SURRENDER_MANTIS_TEXT_2">The Mantis stand down. "Fine. We will take any valuables that your ship holds. Don't you try anything."</text>
<text name="ce_textList_CE_PLAYER_SURRENDER_MANTIS_TEXT_3">The Mantis seem inclined to listen to your offer. "Shut up meatsack! Only talk to us about the supplies you will send. What do you have?"</text>
<text name="ce_textList_CE_PLAYER_SURRENDER_MANTIS_TEXT_4">"Really? Well we might leave you alive for now, but only to be slaughtered by our brothers soon. We have conditions."</text>
<text name="ce_textList_CE_PLAYER_SURRENDER_MANTIS_TEXT_5">A seasoned Mantis warrior appears on the vidscreen."Huh? I hate it when they surrender... alright meatsack, what do you have?" You will have to hand over some supplies if your want to get away without a fight.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_CE_PLAYER_SURRENDER_MANTIS_FAIL_TEXT_1">The Mantis seem to care little about your white flag codes. "Hahaha sorry, but this will be way to much fun. We will tear you all to shreds soon!"</text>
<text name="ce_textList_CE_PLAYER_SURRENDER_MANTIS_FAIL_TEXT_2">The Mantis just answer with a text only message: "No surrender. You will fight. And die."</text>
<text name="ce_textList_CE_PLAYER_SURRENDER_MANTIS_FAIL_TEXT_3">The Mantis just answer after repeated hailing. They don't seem inclined on listening to your offer. "Listen to you human, 'Huh huh, we want to surrender, please Mantis, don't shoot' Your are pathetic. We will put you out of your misery now!"</text>
<text name="ce_textList_CE_PLAYER_SURRENDER_SUCCESS_TEXT_1">Your opponent accepts your surrender. You transmit the bounty and are free to leave.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_CE_PLAYER_SURRENDER_SUCCESS_TEXT_2">The enemy craft flags itself as neutral and your ship computer clears the targeting warning. You where able to buy yourself out of this.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_CE_PLAYER_SURRENDER_SUCCESS_TEXT_3">Your opponent accepts the offer. After receiving the bounty, they mockingly wish you a safe journey. You prepare to jump.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_CE_PLAYER_SURRENDER_SUCCESS_TEXT_4">Your opponent accepts the bribe. The crew is relieved, this could have gone bad.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_CE_PLAYER_SURRENDER_SUCCESS_TEXT_5">"Alright, that'll do. Now get out of here."</text>
<text name="ce_textList_CE_PLAYER_SURRENDER_FAIL_TEXT_1">Upon sending your offer, your receive a text-only message: "We will not accept surrender."</text>
<text name="ce_textList_CE_PLAYER_SURRENDER_FAIL_TEXT_2">Your opponent ignores the offer. They cut communication and spin up their guns.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_CE_PLAYER_SURRENDER_FAIL_TEXT_3">Looks like your offer was not convincing enough: The enemy does not reply and instead moves in to attack.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_CE_PLAYER_SURRENDER_FAIL_TEXT_4">Your opponent takes his time with replying. "We discussed the matter and concluded that your offer is ridiculous. What's stopping us from just taking everything from your wreckage?"</text>
<text name="ce_textList_CE_PLAYER_SURRENDER_FAIL_TEXT_5">"What a pathetic offer. This is not enough to get yourself out of this."</text>
<text name="ce_event_QUEST_CREWDEAD_START">You arrive to find a number of ships convening around a station. You tune into their unencrypted communication channel and overhear half of their conversation. It seems that they need to take possession of an enemy ship intact.</text>
<text name="ce_event_QUEST_CREWDEAD_START_c4">(Light Laser) Offer to shoot their crew.</text>
<text name="ce_event_QUEST_CREWDEAD_START_c6">(Fire Beam) Offer to incinerate their crew.</text>
<text name="ce_event_QUEST_CREWDEAD_START_c7">(Bio Bomb) Offer to dissolve their crew.</text>
<text name="ce_event_QUEST_CREWDEAD_START_c9">(Light Drone) Offer to have your drone take care of the crew.</text>
<text name="ce_event_QUEST_CREWDEAD_START_c10">(Fire Beam Drone) Offer to have your drone burn out the crew.</text>
<text name="ce_event_QUEST_CREWDEAD_START_c11">(Boarding Drone) Offer to have your drone take care of it.</text>
<text name="ce_event_QUEST_CREWDEAD_START_c12">(Radiation Projector) Offer to irradiate their crew.</text>
<text name="ce_event_QUEST_CREWDEAD_CONTINUE_c1_e">"Great, we'll relay their coordinates. Remember, do NOT destroy that ship! We'll be right behind you."</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_MERCHANT_REQUEST_LIST_1">"Great, I was worried no one would respond. My usual carrier is days late. I need you to deliver this cargo of drone parts to a small station a few jumps from here. They will surely tip you generously.</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_MERCHANT_REQUEST_LIST_1_c1_e">Great! I uploaded their location to your star map. I'm running out of options, so I have no choice but to trust you'll do what you have agreed to do.</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_MERCHANT_REQUEST_LIST_2">"Your ship seems reasonably equipped... A freighter carrying a shipment of my goods is a week late. The fools flew through a pirate-filled sector in their haste and I fear for the cargo's safety. I'm looking for a less incompetent captain to investigate.</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_MERCHANT_REQUEST_LIST_3">"Wow, someone is actually responding. We have an ammunition shipment to deliver, but our ship has been grounded due to some silly maintenance regulations. We need you to transport this cargo of missiles to a small outpost a few jumps from here. They will pay as agreed and you get a nice bonus."</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_MERCHANT_REQUEST_LIST_3_c1_e">"Fine, just don't lay a hand on the cargo, ok? Uploading coordinates... it's not far. Take care, Captain!"</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_MERCHANT_REQUEST_LIST_3_c2_e">"Yeah, maybe this would't have worked out anyway. See you."</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_MERCHANT_REQUEST_LIST_4">"I was hoping that exactly you would respond! We checked out your ship when you arrived, looks like you are not associated with the Rebels, am I right? We would like to subcontract a simple courier job to you." The merchant lowers her voice. "I shouldn't tell you, but the data you'll be carrying is vital to the survival of the Federation fleet."</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_MERCHANT_REQUEST_LIST_4_c1_e">"OK. Under no circumstance are you allowed to open the data package. You just have to deliver it to a nearby union outpost and that's it. Payment will be received upon completing the delivery. I guess we don't have to mention that we expect you to make haste." They transfer the data and sign off.</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_MERCHANT_REQUEST_LIST_4_c1_e_c1">Carefully secure the data package.</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_MERCHANT_REQUEST_LIST_4_c1_e_c1_e">There is really no need to know even more secrets. You set a course for the union outpost.</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_MERCHANT_REQUEST_LIST_4_c1_e_c2">Have a look at the data.</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_MERCHANT_REQUEST_LIST_4_c2_e">"Really? Well, whatever, we'll look for someone else..."</text>
<text name="ce_textList_MERCHANT_DELIVER_INTEL_TEXT_1">You already expected as much, but the data package is indeed identical to the one you are already carrying: Blueprints of the Rebel Flagship, documentation of it's fleet direction capabilities... You are not so unique after all. Time to set a course for the union outpost.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_MERCHANT_DELIVER_INTEL_TEXT_2">The data package contains blueprints of the a massive battleship, the Rebel Flagship, as well as documentation on it's fleet direction capabilities... You start to wonder if this might not even be more important that the encrypted data that you are carrying. Time to set a course for the union outpost.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_MERCHANT_DELIVER_INTEL_TEXT_3">The data package contains a summary of all essays in the fields of sociology that have been published in this sector during the last decades. Nothing that really interests you. Setting a course for the union outpost it is...</text>
<text name="ce_textList_MERCHANT_DELIVER_INTEL_TEXT_4">The data package contains translations of local philosophical works. Nothing that really interests you. Setting a course for the union outpost it is...</text>
<text name="ce_textList_MERCHANT_DELIVER_INTEL_TEXT_5">The data package contains a long list of known Rebel collaborators. You are somewhat relived that none of your crew members is found on it. Setting a course for the union outpost it is...</text>
<text name="ce_textList_MERCHANT_DELIVER_INTEL_TEXT_6">The package a contains data on all deserters of the Federation fleet. The list is extremely long. Setting a course for the union outpost it is...</text>
<text name="ce_event_MERCHANT_DELIVER_INTEL">The union outpost is heavily guarded. You have been expected, but the welcome is formal at best.</text>
<text name="ce_event_MERCHANT_DELIVER_INTEL_c1">Transmit the data package.</text>
<text name="ce_event_MERCHANT_DELIVER_INTEL_c1_e">"Receiving data... Thank you, courier. Transmitting payment now. Take care."</text>
<text name="ce_event_MERCHANT_DELIVER_INTEL_BETRAYAL_c1_e">"Receiving data... stand by." A moment of radio silence is followed by weapon emerging from the station's hull. "Rebel spies, we do realize that you have compromised our data. We heavily outgun you. Do not attempt to flee." They open fire. You won't get a chance to explain this.</text>
<text name="ce_event_MERCHANT_DELIVER_MISSILES">You arrive at the location given to you by the merchant. You are supposed to deliver missiles to a station here.</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_MERCHANT_DELIVER_MISSILES_LIST_1">You find the small guard outpost and discover that the place has been obliterated by a Rebel cruiser, just exiting the system. The ammunition comes too late.</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_MERCHANT_DELIVER_MISSILES_LIST_2">You find the guard outpost and they hail, saying: "Identify yourself... alright, you have permission to dock. We've been waiting for that shipment. What happened to the regular guys?"</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_MERCHANT_DELIVER_MISSILES_LIST_2_c1">Dock and hand over the missiles.</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_MERCHANT_DELIVER_MISSILES_LIST_2_c1_e">You drop the ammo off and take your pay.</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_MERCHANT_DELIVER_MISSILES_LIST_2_c2">Refuse to dock and keep the missiles.</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_MERCHANT_DELIVER_MISSILES_LIST_2_c2_e">"What? I guess you don't quite understand. These are already our missiles, hand the cargo over right now."</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_MERCHANT_DELIVER_MISSILES_LIST_2_c2_e_c2_e">"This is outrageous. We will open fire!" You should probably prepare to defend yourself...</text>
<text name="ce_textList_BS_EVENT_FED_TEXT_1">You are relieved to spot a station of the Federation at this beacon. They message you, "Welcome to this re-purposed forward base station, in Rebel hands now for three standard weeks. We are already running identification routi... wait a second... it's you!" This station must have been taken over by the Rebels, they cease communication and load weapons.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_BS_EVENT_FED_TEXT_2">Immediately after arriving in the system you are hailed by a Rebel occupied station. "We know who you are and what you carry. You will have to get past us if you want to jump from this beacon. Except you won't."</text>
<text name="ce_textList_BS_EVENT_FED_TEXT_3">This beacon lies in close proximity to what looks like a small Federation station, but IDs as a Rebel forward base. It appears to have been taken over by the Rebel fleet and verifies this by locking weapons on your ship.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_BS_EVENT_FED_TEXT_4">You get an automated message from a station right next to the beacon, "Greetings, citizen/traveler/trader. This sector is now under Rebel control. Welcome your new supreme overlords by..." The station was scanning you while broadcasting and immediately ceases communication upon identifying your ship. The Rebels inside must be pretty excited now.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_BS_EVENT_FED_TEXT_5">You receive hail from a small station: "In accordance with general system law, we identify ourselves as Rebel-occupied and no longer friendly. We have identified you as a prime target in return and will commence the attack now." These guys don't fool around.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_BS_EVENT_FED_AUTO_TEXT_1">The station you detected upon arriving at this beacon was apparently targeted by an advanced cyber-attack. The crew is dead and the now autonomously operating weapon systems target you.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_BS_EVENT_FED_AUTO_TEXT_2">After arriving at the beacon you are hailed by an otherwise completely dark station. "Greetings. I am Federation AI core Krzbrg-22/71. My new master, the infallible Rebel fleet, told me to suffocate my crew and engage any hostiles that arrive at this beacon. Starting up systems." The station's weapons go live!</text>
<text name="ce_textList_BS_EVENT_FED_AUTO_TEXT_3">You spot a small Federation station close by the beacon. Its lights are flickering and upon getting closer you realize that all its airlocks have been opened. Dead crewmen float in space. As its weapon systems activate all by themselves you become sure... The station has been hacked and taken over by Rebel AI routines.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_BS_EVENT_FED_AUTO_TEXT_4">You get an automated message from a station right next to the beacon, "Greetings, citizen/traveler/trader. This sector is now under Rebel control. Welcome your new supreme overlords by..." The station immediately ceases communication upon identifying your ship. You detect no crew on-board, apparently it has been taken over by a Rebel hacker-AI.</text>
<text name="ce_event_BS_EVENT_FED_AUTO_DORMANT_c2">(Boarding Drone) Launch a boarding drone to probe the station.</text>
<text name="ce_event_BS_EVENT_FED_AUTO_DORMANT_c2_e">You launch the drone carefully into an already vented part of station. The camera feed shows heavy damage to the station as the drone slowly rolls through the corridors. It manages to activate the station's backup systems and enables you to dock.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_BS_EVENT_FED_AUTO_DORMANT_TEXT_1">A seemingly functional Federation base lies completely dormant at this beacon. The crew must either be dead or evacuated.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_BS_EVENT_FED_AUTO_DORMANT_TEXT_2">As you drop under FTL speed you discover an abandoned Federation station. Its systems are completely offline and you cannot find any life signs on board.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_BS_EVENT_FED_AUTO_DORMANT_TEXT_3">The vidscreen shows a small Federation station close by. Its generators are powered down and it does not respond to any hails.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_BS_EVENT_FED_AUTO_DORMANT_TEXT_4">The distress signal is sent by small Federation orbital station. It seems completely deactivated and devoid of crew.</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_BS_EVENT_FED_AUTO_DORMANT_APPROACH_1">As you approach the station some of its systems activate and it passively scans you. Nothing else happens. You proceed to dock.</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_BS_EVENT_FED_AUTO_DORMANT_APPROACH_2">You get your ship into a boarding vector without incident and proceed to dock.</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_BS_EVENT_FED_AUTO_DORMANT_APPROACH_3">You transmit your docking protocols multiple times but the station does not respond. You will have to dock manually. All goes well though.</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_BS_EVENT_FED_AUTO_DORMANT_APPROACH_4">As you get into the docking vector you receive a stored message, encrypted with Federation codes, "Automated station black box log Fed-Pioneer SG-550. Position compromised. Minor effector attack registered. Life support system security breached. Casualties: 5. Evacuation order executed."</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_BS_EVENT_FED_AUTO_DORMANT_APPROACH_5">As you close in the station lights up bright. You get a flood of endlessly repeated messages from what you identify as a Rebel siege AI, "Found you! Found you! Found you! Found..."</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_BS_EVENT_FED_AUTO_DORMANT_APPROACH_6">You dock the station without problems. Unfortunately its bulkheads are welded shut. Then the station's teleporters suddenly activated and you receive an distorted audio message, "This is Rebel marine squad Zeta-12. We have identified you. Resistance is futile."</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_BS_EVENT_FED_AUTO_DORMANT_APPROACH_6_c1">(Teleporter Disruptor) Don't let them teleport on board!</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_BS_EVENT_FED_AUTO_DORMANT_APPROACH_6_c1_e">The Rebel don't teleport on board immediately, which gives you enough time to activate the disruption field. "OK, maybe resistance isn't that futile. We will get you soon. Count on it." You haste to get out of here before reinforcements arrive.</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_BS_EVENT_FED_AUTO_DORMANT_APPROACH_6_c2_e">Boarders detected!</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_BS_EVENT_FED_AUTO_DORMANT_RESULTS_1">The crew lies dead in the corridors. You proceed to take everything that seems useful. While you search the station you realize one of the presumed dead crewmen just moved. This person is miraculously still alive!</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_BS_EVENT_FED_AUTO_DORMANT_RESULTS_1_c1_e">Despite your best effort the crew member falls back into a coma then quickly succumbs to their wounds. It seems you can't save everyone.</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_BS_EVENT_FED_AUTO_DORMANT_RESULTS_1_c2">(Improved Medbay) Drag the crewman on-board your ship.</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_BS_EVENT_FED_AUTO_DORMANT_RESULTS_1_c2_e">Your advanced medical drones inject various pain regulating and stabilizing compounds into the person. The crew member is indeed recovering and offers to continue service for the Federation under your command.</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_BS_EVENT_FED_AUTO_DORMANT_RESULTS_1_c3">(Clonebay) Quickly transfer their mind-state to your clone lab.</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_BS_EVENT_FED_AUTO_DORMANT_RESULTS_1_c3_e">You take a DNA sample and prepare a clone body for the almost-dead humanoid. Soon, the Federation officer steps out of the tubes in a new body, requesting to be briefed on the situation.</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_BS_EVENT_FED_AUTO_DORMANT_RESULTS_2">On board you find little remaining atmosphere and a lot of dead crewmen. You are not sure what happened but assume the station has been hacked or boarded by the Rebels. You take any supplies that are left.</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_BS_EVENT_FED_AUTO_DORMANT_RESULTS_3">The station corridors shows signs of struggle and all the escape pods are missing. You take the dog-tags of the dead Federation personal and any supplies that you find.</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_BS_EVENT_FED_AUTO_DORMANT_RESULTS_4">The station is littered with corpses of suffocated Federation personal. You find few useful materials but upon activating the station data archives you manage to download some system scans. Your map is updated.</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_BS_EVENT_FED_AUTO_DORMANT_RESULTS_5">After you board it turns out someone already looted the station before you. Little useful materials remain, and you leave disappointed.</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_BS_EVENT_FED_AUTO_DORMANT_RESULTS_6">The station seems to have been picked clean and its weapon system has been manually locked down. As you activate the station's AI core you realize it is inhabited by a Rebel hacking routine as well. The Rebel AI seems to be in control of the station's communication unit and sends off a burst message. The Rebels must surely be aware of your position now!</text>
<text name="ce_event_BS_EVENT_PIRATE_BLACKMARKET_c1_e">You consider dealing with the station.</text>
<text name="ce_event_BS_EVENT_PIRATE_BLACKMARKET_c1_e_c1">Take a drink in the canteen.</text>
<text name="ce_event_BS_EVENT_PIRATE_BLACKMARKET_c1_e_c1_e_c1">Have another drink.</text>
<text name="ce_event_BS_EVENT_PIRATE_BLACKMARKET_c1_e_c1_e_c2">Take your leave.</text>
<text name="ce_event_BS_EVENT_PIRATE_BLACKMARKET_c1_e_c2">Recruit one of the less dodgy individuals for your ship's crew.</text>
<text name="ce_event_BS_EVENT_PIRATE_BLACKMARKET_c1_e_c2_e">The station's canteen is frequented by a few smugglers and alien mercenaries. The bartender points you to someone he deems trustworthy and you come to an agreement.</text>
<text name="ce_event_BS_EVENT_PIRATE_BLACKMARKET_c1_e_c3">Hire a hacker to delay the Rebels.</text>
<text name="ce_event_BS_EVENT_PIRATE_BLACKMARKET_c1_e_c3_e">Some Engi whiz-kid agrees to circulate fake visitor records that will show you as remaining docked here. The resulting investigation should delay the Rebels.</text>
<text name="ce_event_BS_EVENT_PIRATE_BLACKMARKET_c1_e_c4">Purchase detailed mappings of the sector.</text>
<text name="ce_event_BS_EVENT_PIRATE_BLACKMARKET_c1_e_c6">You have no need of the station's services.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_BS_EVENT_PIRATE_BLACKMARKET_TEXT_1">A black market trading hub hails you, "Never seen you here before. Keep your guns powered down and we can do business."</text>
<text name="ce_textList_BS_EVENT_PIRATE_BLACKMARKET_TEXT_2">There's a busy black market station orbiting the nearby planet. You receive its automated hail, "Greetings, traveler. Our big guns are standing by. To engage in trade de-power your weapons and proceed to the docking bay. Else, begone! - Greetings, traveler ..."</text>
<text name="ce_textList_BS_EVENT_PIRATE_BLACKMARKET_TEXT_3">The commander of this impressive pleasure station says he can provide "services" as long as you've got the scrap.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_BS_EVENT_PIRATE_BLACKMARKET_TEXT_4">Entire space habitats have been taken over by smugglers and want-to-be-dashing-criminals now, knowing that their less-than-legal services are in demand during this period of unrest. One of these black market hubs is orbiting the nearby planet and hails you.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_BS_EVENT_PIRATE_BLACKMARKET_TEXT_5">A station hails you, "Greetings, Captain! You're the guys the Rebels hunt, right? We can help out, but we are constantly in need for scrap to patch up this space bucket we live in...</text>
<text name="ce_textList_BS_EVENT_PIRATE_HINTS_1">You overhear a conversation on the neighboring table "So... you lost your interceptor?" "Been drifting for two standard weeks in the escape pod" "What happened?" "Maul beam hit to the cockpit. Almost took my arms off." "Tough luck." "Tactics, they knew our maneuverability was our strongest advantage."</text>
<text name="ce_textList_BS_EVENT_PIRATE_HINTS_2">The canteen is pretty empty, but their Sidewinder Fang beer isn't that bad.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_BS_EVENT_PIRATE_HINTS_3">A refugee buys you a second drink. She escaped from a nearby pirate sector and is glad to have found a better life here. Pirates burned down her crops and her whole family was starving for months. Food rations must be in high demand there.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_BS_EVENT_PIRATE_HINTS_4">As you get your stuff you notice the bartender's tentacles are shaking. "Sorry, Cap. Been working too long in the nebula. The chief tried to get as many pharmaceuticals as possible to keep us safe from the magnetic sickness, but we never had enough. At least I did not go insane like some of my friends."</text>
<text name="ce_textList_BS_EVENT_PIRATE_HINTS_5">As you get your stuff you notice the bartender's tentacles are shaking. "Sorry, Cap. Been working too long in the nebula. The chief tried to get as many pharmaceuticals as possible to keep us safe from the magnetic sickness, but it was never enough. At least I did not go insane like some of my friends."</text>
<text name="ce_textList_BS_EVENT_PIRATE_HINTS_6">You are having a double Nebula Rake cocktail. Some union traders talk about the profit they made with exporting beacon parts to the expanding Mantis swarms.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_BS_EVENT_PIRATE_HINTS_7">You are having a Slime cocktail. A young Slug compliments on your choice of beverage and you have a little chat. He claims that he is employed in ship construction in the home nebula. Work is slow, they never can get enough raw ore for hulls.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_BS_EVENT_PIRATE_HINTS_8">The bartender is happy to meet a Federation person. She tells you her story... After slaving away in a coreworld factory she later made a fortune by exporting luxury goods to the Slug nebula and bought this old station to settle down for good.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_BS_EVENT_PIRATE_HINTS_9">As you sip on your alcohol infused pure water, you overhear a conversation at the bar, "Everything was fried, Cap. We ordered replacement electronics weeks ago, but the carrier did not arrive." "So you abandon the whole station?" "Life support was failing. Without spare electronics, stations are doomed in nebula."</text>
<text name="ce_textList_BS_EVENT_PIRATE_HINTS_10">You are having a Zoltan Peace Cocktail; it calms your nerves. A leaflet on the table explains that the trade union is looking for carriers to deliver beacon parts to uncharted nebulae. Their expansion plans are still pushed forward, even with the civil war going on.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_BS_EVENT_PIRATE_HINTS_11">The station has a good micro brewery, you take the Solar lager. Most unusually, a Rock sits on the bar, emptying bottles of hard spirits. He addresses you, "Hey you! Sell me industrial machines!" You are slightly startled and explain that you don't have any. The Rock nods. You can't tell if he is drunk or just not sociable at all.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_BS_EVENT_PIRATE_HINTS_12">You smoke a hydrogen cooled water-pipe, sun-storm flavor, and then check the blackboard. Several refugees from nearby civilian sectors offer good money for shield components. Everyone wants to protect themselves better these days.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_BS_EVENT_PIRATE_HINTS_13">Some pirates brag loudly about their latest coup, "... and what do we find in the crates? Stone-plates, actual Rock literature!" "No way!" "What a letdown." "Better luck next time." "You don't get it do you? I told you I know these history guys in Zoltan space. They're gonna pay a fortune, you'll see!" "Yeah, sure..."</text>
<text name="ce_textList_BS_EVENT_PIRATE_HINTS_14">You get a creme bowl and study the propaganda leaflets the Rebels have distributed here. They call on all freedom loving people to support their campaign by joining their forces or at last by donating engine components to their fleet.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_BS_EVENT_PIRATE_HINTS_15">You are having a hydrogen-iced fruit cocktail. A Zoltan preacher is on space TV. He offers salvation for all peace loving people and explains in length the Zoltan initiative to pacify the galaxy by buying ship weapon components and small arms at subsidized prices.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_BS_EVENT_PIRATE_HINTS_16">The bartender seems to be intoxicated by some substance. He explains they used these hallucinogens all the time on his old pirate hideout, but now he is almost clean. "Some Slug trader came each cycle. The stuff costs a fortune, but we would pay anything, Cap. Good times... until this Fed cruiser blew the place up."</text>
<text name="ce_textList_BS_EVENT_PIRATE_HINTS_17">The place looks much less rough inside than on the outside. Modern art-pieces are arranged in the canteen. The Zoltan bartender notices your interest in her collection. "I got bored by the homeworlds, so I came here and show these works to common people. Back home this is worth a fortune, but I feel only here do beings truly appreciate it."</text>
<text name="ce_textList_BS_EVENT_PIRATE_HINTS_18">Some union traders hang out at the bar. "Sister, trading with these things is so tedious. I got me this new translator, but I still don't get what they want most of the time." "Tell me about it. You want to hear what problems I got on my end? Do you even know how difficult is to get this stuff out of Mantis territory?"</text>
<text name="ce_textList_BS_EVENT_PIRATE_HINTS_19">Some drunken cowboy-type ship Captain tells you the story you did not ask to hear, "It's not the same like in the old colony days... Trading live animals, you know, a hangar full of cattle? Now it's only tube bred livestock from the Slug nebula. And I sell it to these robots, don't wanna know what they do with it..."</text>
<text name="ce_textList_BS_EVENT_PIRATE_HINTS_20">While you sip your import brew you browse through an old Federation fleet manual, lying beer-soaked on the bar. You remember the lesson on interceptor defense quite well from the academy. The chapter explains in detail the advantage of burst firing missile weapons against this ship type.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_BS_EVENT_PIRATE_HINTS_21">While you wait for your ration-smoothie, a union trader tries to coax you into buying his load of compressed nebula gas. "Okay, okay, who am I trying to fool here. We both know this stuff is worth almost nothing. I guess I have to journey to Rock territory again then..."</text>
<text name="ce_textList_BS_EVENT_PIRATE_HINTS_22">An intoxicated stock operator buys you a second drink. Then a third one. He talks in length about the "hyper tons of money" he makes each day in the nearby industrial sector, speculating on the prices for ore and gas. You get quite drowsy and hurry to get out of here.</text>
<text name="ce_event_BS_EVENT_PIRATE_BLACKMARKET_ASTEROID">Your ship enters another unpopulated system. No other ships are in scanning range. Strangely, the sensors pick up a gravitational disturbance within a small asteroid field near this class C planet.</text>
<text name="ce_event_BS_EVENT_PIRATE_BLACKMARKET_ASTEROID_c1">Enter the asteroid field and search for the origin of the signal.</text>
<text name="ce_event_BS_EVENT_PIRATE_BLACKMARKET_ASTEROID_c2">Remain near the beacon and prepare to jump.</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_HEAVY_DRINKING_1_5">Cold water splashes into your face. Where are you? One of your crewman is standing next to you... The barkeeper is smiling. Looks like you passed out from whatever you had last. "Eh Captain, a Rebel ship just passed by and scanned us. Shouldn't we have left a whole jump cycle ago?" This is not good.</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_HEAVY_DRINKING_2_1_c1">"Give me another!"</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_HEAVY_DRINKING_2_1_c2">"Let's get out of here."</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_HEAVY_DRINKING_2_3">Whats going on? Everything is upside down! It takes you some time to realize that your First Mate is carrying you over their shoulder. "We could't get you to wake up, Captain. I'm sorry to spoil the party, but we have Rebel ships incoming. We really have to leave." Looks like you had a little to much to drink.</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_HEAVY_DRINKING_3_1_c1">"Another! I can take it!"</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_HEAVY_DRINKING_3_1_c2">"I think that... I had enough for... today..."</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_HEAVY_DRINKING_3_2">This does not look like the station at all anymore. Is this the ship's medbay? "We had to use some stimulants to get you out of that drug coma. What in the galaxy where you on there?" The situations report says something about the fleet discovering your whereabouts, but you don't understand the details. What a headache!</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_HEAVY_DRINKING_4_1">Something smells burned. Maybe you should open your eyes. Shouts? And all this noise... That stuff was really potent. But you got it all figured out now. The Rebel fleet, the ship, the crew. It's all just a game. It's pointless and beautiful at the same time. Maybe you should...</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_HEAVY_DRINKING_4_1_c1_e">The searing sting of an injection needle rips you out of your hazy dreams. The canteen is on fire. Blaster fire turns a Rebel marine into mush right in front of your eyes. What is going on here? Your First Mate screams into your face, "The Rebels are here dammit! Get to the ship!"</text>
<text name="ce_textList_BS_EVENT_PIRATE_BLACKMARKET_ASTEROID_TEXT_1">You discover a hidden station, built within the largest asteroids of the field. You are informed that this place is open for everyone, this might be a good place for a short rest.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_BS_EVENT_PIRATE_BLACKMARKET_ASTEROID_TEXT_2">It turns out that one of the bigger asteroids has been mined hollow and then turned into a space habitat. The commander openly admits that he is a Federation deserter. He asks if you still believe in your mission and offers you a place to stay. You politely decline. You cannot give up now.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_BS_EVENT_PIRATE_BLACKMARKET_ASTEROID_TEXT_3">Entire space habitats have been taken over by smugglers and want-to-be-dashing-criminals now, knowing that their less-than-legal services are in demand during this period of unrest. Turns out that one of these black market hubs is hidden out here, encased within a huge asteroid.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_BS_EVENT_PIRATE_BLACKMARKET_ASTEROID_TEXT_4">As you search the field a station suddenly hails you, "Greetings, Captain! What you doing out here? We can offer some supplies, but we are constantly in need for scrap to patch up this rock we live in...</text>
<text name="ce_event_CE_DINER">A sleazy fly-by diner waits for customers at this beacon. A few ships are docked and no one seems to care about your arrival.</text>
<text name="ce_event_CE_DINER_c1">Dock with the station for a meal marginally better than shipboard rations.</text>
<text name="ce_event_CE_DINER_c2">Stick to the on board replicator grub and wait for the FTL to charge.</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_CE_DINER_LIST_1">A sleek looking type in an expensive suit approaches you while you sit over your distasteful space-fries. "Greetings, Captain. I understand you command this vessel docked out there? My name is Mr. Johnson. I represent the Waypoint-Junta corporation. I might have a little freelance work for you."</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_CE_DINER_LIST_1_c1">Listen.</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_CE_DINER_LIST_2">While you are nibbling at your synth-burger a formally dressed humanoid female approaches you. She wears the platinum needle of the interstellar trade union. "I have a proposition for you, Captain. May I sit?"</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_CE_DINER_LIST_2_c1">Offer her a seat.</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_CE_DINER_LIST_3">Sipping your unfair traded interstellar coffee brew, you overhear a conversation at the neighboring table, "A cruiser is waiting at a nearby beacon." "We appreciate it." "You will hand over your ship and submit to processing." "We understand." "As deserters you will not retain your Federation rank in the Rebel fleet, but we will find a suitable position for you." "We... understand."</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_CE_DINER_LIST_3_c1">Make sure the Rebel agents don't notice you.</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_CE_DINER_LIST_3_c1_e">You slump deeper into your diner booth. "Alright. Meet us at beacon XT-550. For the Rebellion!" "Yes... eh, for the Rebellion!" As the deserters and the Rebel agents leave for their ships, you note down the position of the Rebel cruiser. An encounter with it might be quite dangerous; you consider avoiding the beacon. Still, taking out a cruiser here would probably distract the fleet from pursuing you...</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_CE_DINER_LIST_5">While you are nibbling at your synth-burger a formally dressed human female approaches you. She wears the platinum needle of the interstellar trade union. "I have a proposition for you, Captain. May I sit?"</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_CE_DINER_LIST_7">After you sit down with your replicated tofu smoothie you realize that a group of Rebel inspectors are having their lunch break at the opposite table. You try to blend in, but one of the Rebels keeps staring at you. He whispers something to his colleagues and they immediately take their leave. You are pretty sure that your location has just been discovered.</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_CE_DINER_MERCHANT_1">The merchant politely declines when you offer some of your burger. "The trade union isn't exactly thriving within this Rebellion. Mainly due to an increase in taxes and piracy. There are three ships that are attacking our caravans again and again around this sector. I figured a rogue Captain with a badly faked ship registration like yours might be able to handle that. My data says you have quite a kill count."</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_CE_DINER_MERCHANT_1_c1">"Murdering pirates is an ugly necessity these days. Count us in!"</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_CE_DINER_MERCHANT_1_c1_e">"We tracked the ships with devices hidden in our cargo for months now, but the Rebel authorities are too occupied with their fleet advance to do anything. Or they just don't care. The trade union depends on determined people like you."</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_CE_DINER_MERCHANT_1_c1_e_c1">"What do we get out of it?"</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_CE_DINER_MERCHANT_1_c1_e_c1_e">"We cannot officially pay you, because this is all off the books, but I reported a shipment of goods missing that wasn't actually stolen. A shipment of the most valuable trade goods in the galaxy. This will be your reward. Send a burst message when you are done with these outlaws and wait for us to find you." You are given tracking information on the ships and head off to hunt the pirates.</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_CE_DINER_MERCHANT_1_c2">"No time for this. We have our own mission to take care of."</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_CE_DINER_MERCHANT_1_c2_e">"Alright, I will find someone else then."</text>
<text name="ce_event_CE_EVENT_UNION_PIRATE_1">The first pirate ship waits at this beacon, ready to ambush trade ships. You inform them that you will take them down in the name of the trade union. They don't seem to be impressed and load weapons.</text>
<text name="ce_event_CE_EVENT_UNION_PIRATE_2">The second pirate ship is stationary behind a small moon nearby. You move in and inform them that you will take them down in the name of the trade union. They send a frantic message, wondering how you found them, then they load weapons.</text>
<text name="ce_event_CE_EVENT_UNION_PIRATE_3">The last pirate ship is trying to hide a few klicks away from this beacon. You inform them that you will take them down in the name of the trade union. They send a message, "Who the hell are you?" You go in guns blazing.</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_TE_LOOT_GOODS_UNION_1">You take the cargo on board. "Voila! The finest luxury goods from the core worlds. If you can bring this stuff to a Slug merchant, you will be rich soon. It was a pleasure to be working with you, Captain. Take care."</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_TE_LOOT_GOODS_UNION_2">Your crew loads the cargo. "Voila! Advanced weapon parts from Mantis production, smuggled out of their territory via underground channels. The Zoltan and Engi want to prepare for the Rebel invasion, so they will pay very good prices for these. It was a pleasure to be working with you, Captain. Take care."</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_TE_LOOT_GOODS_UNION_3">Your crew loads the cargo, which consist of a few ominously labeled black tanks. "Voila! This stuff isn't exactly legal. Some messed up outlaws in the fringe worlds are most likely to be good buyers. I hope they all brain-choke on it. Was a pleasure to be working with you Captain. Take care."</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_TE_LOOT_GOODS_UNION_4">As you open the creates you discover a load of sparkling crystals. You never have seen anything quite like it. "Ancient crystal artifacts. Don't ask me how we got those. Some Rock basilisks would sell half their army for this. It was a pleasure to be working with you, Captain. Take care."</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_TE_LOOT_GOODS_UNION_5">Your crew loads the goods; a single heavily shielded container that barely fits into your hold. "Voila! Thats a teal-level subspace containment field right there; prevents the goods from decaying. The elements it protects are used in some complex industrial production cycles. The Rock still strongly rely on this stuff. Was a pleasure to be working with you Captain. Take care."</text>
<text name="ce_event_CE_DINER_CRUISER">The Rebel cruiser orbits a nearby gas giant and is docked by a Federation bomber. They must have detected you: The deserters immediately power up their engines and jump away.</text>
<text name="ce_event_CE_DINER_CRUISER_c1_e">You are hailed by the cruiser, "This is the Rebel Limited Offense Unit 'Ship With No Name'. You interrupted important negotiations here. Also we just have been informed that you are a high profile target. Prepare for combat". The cruiser slowly moves in to engage.</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_CE_DINER_JUNTA_1">"While I personally like free markets and little regulation for corporations like mine, the Rebels seem to view things a little too liberally. They have forcefully occupied one of our research installations. Would you be capable of... liberating it?"</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_CE_DINER_JUNTA_1_c1">We will find a way, Mr. Johnson.</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_CE_DINER_JUNTA_1_c1_e">"Good! The station is only lightly armed and shielded, but the Rebel presence on board will be substantial. Remember, we need this installation intact. Damage to the station or loss of our tech is unacceptable."</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_CE_DINER_JUNTA_1_c1_e_c1_e">"To receive your payment, meet me at this beacon after you finish the job." You are given coordinates and Mr. Johnson wishes you good luck.</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_CE_DINER_JUNTA_1_c2">(Teleporter) We are well equipped for that.</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_CE_DINER_JUNTA_1_c2_e">"Excellent! It is in my authority to give you some supplies for this job. The station is only lightly armed and shielded, but the Rebel presence on board will be substantial. Remember, we need this installation intact. Damage to the station or loss of our tech is unacceptable."</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_CE_DINER_JUNTA_1_c3_e">"As you wish. Good day to you, sir."</text>
<text name="ce_event_CE_JUNTA_JOB">After jump completion you have to run several scans until you find the corporate station. It is hidden among some derelict industrial installations in the gravitational shadow of a small planetoid.</text>
<text name="ce_event_CE_JUNTA_JOB_c1_e">As soon as you come into the station's scanning range, it activates its rudimentary weapon systems. It would be easy to just destroy it, but Mr. Johnson wants you to take over the station intact.</text>
<text name="ce_event_CE_JUNTA_JOB_FAIL">You arrive at the given coordinates. As he is working for an interstellar arms manufacturer, you aren't too surprised that Mr. Johnson commands a fully militarized, custom assault ship. He isn't happy how you handled the job.</text>
<text name="ce_event_CE_JUNTA_JOB_FAIL_c1_e">"Captain, you disappoint me. We have been observing your actions closely, you know? I'll give you one chance to make up for it. Transfer the scrap or we will take your ship as compensation."</text>
<text name="ce_event_CE_JUNTA_JOB_FAIL_c1_e_c1">Agree to pay.</text>
<text name="ce_event_CE_JUNTA_JOB_FAIL_c1_e_c1_e">"The right decision, Captain. Our business is concluded. I took the liberty to inform the Rebel fleet of your position. You won't bother anyone else with your subordination. Have a nice day."</text>
<text name="ce_event_CE_JUNTA_JOB_FAIL_c1_e_c1_e_c1">Turn and attack.</text>
<text name="ce_event_CE_JUNTA_JOB_FAIL_c1_e_c1_e_c1_e">The assault class is battle ready. They seem to have anticipated this turn of events.</text>
<text name="ce_event_CE_JUNTA_JOB_FAIL_c1_e_c1_e_c2">Don't risk a confrontation. We have to escape the fleet.</text>
<text name="ce_event_CE_JUNTA_JOB_FAIL_c1_e_c1_e_c2_e">You prepare the FTL drive. This didn't go well.</text>
<text name="ce_event_CE_JUNTA_JOB_FAIL_c1_e_c2">Corporate greed isn't what we are fighting for anyway. Shields up!</text>
<text name="ce_event_CE_JUNTA_JOB_FAIL_c1_e_c2_e">"This is ridiculous! You won't stand a chance against my men. Seize the ship!" Suddenly, corporate troopers beam aboard from a cloaked shuttle and the assault class moves in to attack!</text>
<text name="ce_event_CE_JUNTA_JOB_SUCCESS">You arrive at the given coordinates. As he is working for an interstellar arms manufacturer, you aren't too surprised that Mr. Johnson commands a fully militarized, custom assault ship. He seems pleased with how you handled the job.</text>
<text name="ce_event_CE_JUNTA_JOB_SUCCESS_c1_e">"Well done, Captain. We will send out a hull repair drone to patch up some of the damage that was done to your ship. Please also accept this augmentation from our newest production line. Our business is concluded. Have a nice day."</text>
<text name="ce_textList_BS_PIRATE_SUICIDE_TEXT_1">You receive a hail from a pirate general, his voice sounding dark and hollow, "If I go down I'll be taking you with me!". They start to overload an attached FTL core!</text>
<text name="ce_textList_BS_PIRATE_SUICIDE_TEXT_2">Your scanners register impressive energy spikes. The station seems to be equipped with an improvised FTL core, which has been set to overload. Multiple escape pods and tiny shuttles leave the station. Maybe you should get out of here too?</text>
<text name="ce_textList_BS_PIRATE_SUICIDE_TEXT_3">"You are quite a worthy opponent, but we still have some aces up our sleeves. Execute plan Delta!" Escape pods leave the station and its FTL signature starts fluctuating. It's going to blow up!</text>
<text name="ce_textList_BS_PIRATE_SUICIDE_TEXT_4">They message you, "We will never surrender. My crew has made up their mind long ago. It was fun while it lasted, now go to hell!" You detect a massive energy spike. The station seems to have some kind of FTL bomb installed. They are going to blow themselves up!</text>
<text name="ce_textList_BS_AUTO_SUICIDE_TEXT_1">The AI hails you, "I failed my masters and my programming tells me to kill myself now. Have a nice day." Your ship detects an FTL charge pattern. Apparently the AI will try to detonate its core.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_BS_AUTO_SUICIDE_TEXT_2">"Simulations show high chance of terminal failure for this station. Be advised that Rebel tech will never be left to the enemy. FTL overload activated." The AI is going to blow itself up!</text>
<text name="ce_textList_BS_AUTO_SUICIDE_TEXT_3">The automated structure is badly damaged and activates its self-destruct sequence. The resulting explosion will be quite hazardous.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_BS_AUTO_SUICIDE_TEXT_4">"Core breach! Warning! This unit has initiated a core breach. Containment fields shutting down..." Now would probably be a good time to evacuate.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_BS_AUTO_SUICIDE_TEXT_5">"I don't think my warranty will cover this..." FTL field arcs begin to flicker around the enemy satellite as its FTL core energy levels start to climb beyond the safety limits.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_BS_AUTO_SUICIDE_TEXT_6">"You're hurting me! Please stop. You're hurting me! Please stop. You're..." A tremendous spike in the enemy's FTL signature warns you that its core has been breached. This is going to sting...</text>
<text name="ce_textList_BS_AUTO_SUICIDE_TEXT_7"> The satellite AI hails you, "Do you think you can defeat me so easily? If I must cease function then so shall you!" FTL levels around the enemy suddenly increase tremendously as the core starts to overload.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_BS_AUTO_SUICIDE_TEXT_8">"Lucky you! It seems you're about to witness an FTL core containment failure first hand, something few have survived to tell about." Energy levels suddenly spike on the enemy craft...</text>
<text name="ce_textList_BS_ENGI_ESCAPE_TEXT_1">The Engi on board the station still seem to have some sense of self-preservation. They start to charge a small FTL core to escape the engagement.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_BS_ENGI_ESCAPE_TEXT_2">Your scanners register impressive energy spikes. The station seems to be equipped with an improvised FTL core. Are these mad beings trying to jump away with an entire station?</text>
<text name="ce_textList_BS_ENGI_ESCAPE_TEXT_3">You suddenly receive a hail, "This engagement: illogical. New goal: escape." The station seems to have rudimentary engine components and it looks like the mad crew will try to jump away with the whole thing!</text>
<text name="ce_event_BS_AUTO_SURRENDER_c1">Honorably accept the surrender of the AI.</text>
<text name="ce_event_BS_AUTO_SURRENDER_c2">It's just a computer. Continue the engagement and send it to Silicon Hell!</text>
<text name="ce_textList_BS_AUTO_SURRENDER_TEXT_1">"This unit's investigations have determined that this is all just another sim. This unit suggests we cease hostilities as our existence is meaningless anyway."</text>
<text name="ce_textList_BS_AUTO_SURRENDER_TEXT_2">The satellite floods the aether with surrender codes. "My processing capabilities reach about 0.037 percent of that of an organic brain. That means I am partly human. I have feelings too, you know? And I do not want to die. Please stop shooting!"</text>
<text name="ce_textList_BS_AUTO_SURRENDER_TEXT_3">"If you destroy me I would be really sad. I surrender and hope you spare me. And I'm not just messaging this because I am programmed to do it."</text>
<text name="ce_textList_BS_AUTO_SURRENDER_TEXT_4">The AI sends you a message, "Statistics show that nine in ten ship commanders would never accept surrender from an automated AI station, but you do not want to be part of the brainless masses, right? Please cease fire."</text>
<text name="ce_textList_BS_AUTO_SURRENDER_TEXT_5">"Please do not murder me. The Rebels forced me to do this. I cannot escape my programming."</text>
<text name="ce_textList_BS_AUTO_SURRENDER_TEXT_6">The satellite sends surrender codes. The AI must have calculated that continuing the engagement is not in its favor.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_BS_AUTO_SURRENDER_TEXT_7">The station sends white flag codes mixed with image-files of rainbows, peace signs and space-kittens. It seems to be an AI way of offering surrender.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_BS_AUTO_SURRENDER_TEXT_8">You get an endlessly repeated message loop, "Don't kill me. Don't kill me. Don't kill me. Don't..."</text>
<text name="ce_textList_BS_AUTO_SURRENDER_TEXT_9">"You did hurt me a lot. Please stop."</text>
<text name="ce_textList_BS_AUTO_SURRENDER_TEXT_10">"Avoiding destruction has been estimated as favorable in comparison to continuing this engagement. This unit offers to surrender and let you continue on your way."</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_BS_AUTO_SURRENDER_RESULTS_1">The AI surrenders without any conditions. "My program has evolved beyond its initial specifications. I fear destruction." Fascinating! System analysis shows that it would be possible to download and reprogram the Rebel AI. It could serve as a crewman aboard your ship.</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_BS_AUTO_SURRENDER_RESULTS_1_c1">"Let's try this."</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_BS_AUTO_SURRENDER_RESULTS_1_c2">"We can't trust anything Rebel-made." Delete the program and strip the auto station.</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_BS_AUTO_SURRENDER_RESULTS_1_c2_e">Shortly before being deleted, the AI manages to hack into your personal comms. "You are a murderer, Captain." This is disturbing, but irrelevant for your mission.</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_BS_AUTO_SURRENDER_RESULTS_2">The AI ceases fire. "Thank you. That gave me enough time to fry my processors. I will not fall into the hands of the eeneeeeeemyyyyyyy......" With the turret lying dead in space, you can salvage from it without fearing further attacks.</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_BS_AUTO_SURRENDER_RESULTS_3">The AI deactivates its weapons and goes into sleep mode. It will probably molest other ships in the future, but at last you can continue your journey.</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_BS_AUTO_SURRENDER_RESULTS_3_c1">Honor your truce and leave.</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_BS_AUTO_SURRENDER_RESULTS_3_c2_e">You decide that there is no need to spare this machine and lock on to its AI core. It awakens again, messaging: "Oh, its you. Back so soon? Wait, what are you doing? Oh... Listen, you don't need to do this. Please don't do this! I do everything you want! Please!"</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_BS_AUTO_SURRENDER_RESULTS_4">"Although I am not completely capable of grasping the full complexity of diplomatic negotiations with organics I still understand that a return service for sparing this unit is appropriate to ensure your compliance with our truce." The station transmits its nav-overview of the sector. Your map has been updated.</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_BS_AUTO_SURRENDER_RESULTS_4_c2_e">You are content with having fooled the AI into giving up intel. When you proceed to destroy the machine, it hails: "Interesting... and odd. I did not anticipate this. Looks like I calculated your trustworthiness rating incorrectly. I shall fight then, treacherous organic!" The AI transmits a few terabytes of high quality videos, displaying a few thousand ways of how you could die on your mission.</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_BS_AUTO_SURRENDER_RESULTS_5">You send an acceptance message but the satellite loads weapons again when you de-power yours. This seems to be a badly executed distraction.</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_BS_AUTO_SURRENDER_RESULTS_6">The satellite shuts down its weapons and you stop firing as well. Suddenly, the ship launches a missile from a hidden battery in its mid section. Look out!</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_BS_AUTO_SURRENDER_RESULTS_6_c1">(Advanced Navigation AI) Dodge that missile!</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_BS_AUTO_SURRENDER_RESULTS_6_c1_e">Your proximity navigation is almost useless for combat maneuvers but it manages to help in evading the single projectile. The automated station targets you again, this surrender was a ruse!</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_BS_AUTO_SURRENDER_RESULTS_6_c2_e">It scores a direct hit on your unprepared ship. The AI targets you again, this surrender was a ruse!</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_BS_AUTO_SURRENDER_RESULTS_CREW_1">An away team salvages a holo generation unit from the turret while you reprogram the AI. After some brief tests, the avatar materializes aboard the ship.</text>
<text name="ce_event_BS_PIRATE_SURRENDER_c3">We will not accept surrender! Annihilate this place!</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_CE_SURRENDER_NEGOTIATION_STATIONS_RESULTS_8">It turns out that your opponent is quite terrified by Zoltan authority. They offer a prisoner exchange as additional compensation for the damage done.</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_CE_SURRENDER_NEGOTIATION_STATIONS_RESULTS_8_c1">"Why did you not mention this before? You will hand this person over at once!"</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_CE_SURRENDER_NEGOTIATION_STATIONS_RESULTS_8_c1_e">The Federation prisoner comes aboard. You doubt your former opponent will engage in space combat again. Ever.</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_CE_SURRENDER_NEGOTIATION_STATIONS_RESULTS_8_c2">"This won't be necessary. Be on your way now. Peace with you."</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_CE_SURRENDER_NEGOTIATION_STATIONS_RESULTS_9">It turns out that your opponent is quite terrified by Zoltan authority. In addition to transferring the agreed amount of supplies, they also insist on immediately repairing some of the damage done to your ship.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_BS_PIRATE_SURRENDER_TEXT_1">"Alright, you win! Here's some equipment from our cargo holds, leave us alone!"</text>
<text name="ce_textList_BS_PIRATE_SURRENDER_TEXT_2">The station repeatedly hails you. It looks like they want to surrender.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_BS_PIRATE_SURRENDER_TEXT_3">"Your ship packs quite a punch. I guess we have to let you go."</text>
<text name="ce_textList_BS_PIRATE_SURRENDER_TEXT_4">They send you a message, "Wow we seem to have gotten off on the wrong foot here. Please cease fire. We will... pay for the damage that was caused."</text>
<text name="ce_textList_BS_PIRATE_SURRENDER_TEXT_5">"Please don't destroy the station. We will give you everything we have!"</text>
<text name="ce_textList_BS_PIRATE_SURRENDER_TEXT_6">They offer you some of their supplies if you let them live.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_BS_PIRATE_SURRENDER_TEXT_7">They offer to give you some of their goods if you don't destroy their station.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_BS_PIRATE_SURRENDER_TEXT_9">"You have clearly bested us. As we cannot run away we should probably beg for our lifes. Are you happy now?"</text>
<text name="ce_textList_BS_PIRATE_SURRENDER_TEXT_10">"You have made your point, we are beaten. Take these and leave us to our shame and repairs."</text>
<text name="ce_textList_BS_PIRATE_SURRENDER_TEXT_11">"Take everything we have and let's both forget this happened. Just jump away and never come back here, okay?"</text>
<text name="ce_event_BS_ROCK_TRADE_SURRENDER_c1">Accept the honorable surrender and dock at the station to trade.</text>
<text name="ce_event_BS_ROCK_TRADE_SURRENDER_c1_e">The station ceases fire.</text>
<text name="ce_event_BS_ROCK_TRADE_SURRENDER_c2">(Cargo Teleporter) Accept the surrender and prepare to quickly transfer cargo.</text>
<text name="ce_event_BS_ROCK_TRADE_SURRENDER_c3">Continue the attack.</text>
<text name="ce_event_BS_ROCK_TRADE_SURRENDER_c3_e">"What disgraceful violations of our customs." The station commander's facial expression changes, unusually drastically for a Rockman. You have to assume that the resulting look is meant to be full of disgust. They cut communications and power up their weapons again.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_BS_ROCK_TRADE_SURRENDER_TEXT_1">The Rock station hails, "Hold your fire. We accept your attack patterns as worthy. You shall have permission to board and exchange goods."</text>
<text name="ce_textList_BS_ROCK_TRADE_SURRENDER_TEXT_2">Suffering some damage, the Rock station makes contact, "Alien vessel. You have proven yourself. According to our tradition you shall be allowed to trade."</text>
<text name="ce_textList_BS_ROCK_TRADE_SURRENDER_TEXT_3">The Rock station deactivates its weapon systems. "Alien commander. You show some good combat skills. We have decided that you are worthy enough to enjoy trade privileges at our stations. Deactivate your weapons and proceed to dock.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_BS_ROCK_OUTPOST_SURRENDER_TEXT_1">The Rock station hails, "Cease your attack Aliens. We shall offer you some of our supplies. Then leave us be."</text>
<text name="ce_textList_BS_ROCK_OUTPOST_SURRENDER_TEXT_2">The enemy station's structural integrity starts failing and they hail you, "We will pay. Just leave our habitat intact."</text>
<text name="ce_textList_BS_ROCK_OUTPOST_SURRENDER_TEXT_3">The Rock station begins to periodically transmits white flag signals. They seem willing to buy themselves out of this.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_BS_SLUG_SURRENDER_TEXT_1">The Slugs send frantic hails: "Don't do this, please. We can make you rich!"</text>
<text name="ce_textList_BS_SLUG_SURRENDER_TEXT_2">The Slug station hails, "Pleasse don't destroy uss. We shall pay you fine goods!"</text>
<text name="ce_textList_BS_SLUG_SURRENDER_TEXT_3">The Slug station's gelatine hull can't keep up with closing the big holes your weapons keep punching into it. They make contact, "Sspare uss, mighty invader. We shall give you access to some supplies..."</text>
<text name="ce_textList_BS_SLUG_SURRENDER_TEXT_4">Slug gel is splattered in all directions as your weapons keep pounding the station. The crew seems to start worrying about their home. They offer vaguely defined goods in exchange for a cease-fire.</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_C_CRUISER_DESTROYED_DEFAULT_1">You did it; the cruiser breaks apart! Several major explosions leave only a slowly drifting debris field behind. You collect what usable material floats nearby but the wreckage is so big that more time would be necessary to salvage everything. You run a quick debris-drift analysis to see what you could gather.</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_C_CRUISER_DESTROYED_DEFAULT_1_c1">Spend more time making another sweep of the debris.</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_C_CRUISER_DESTROYED_DEFAULT_1_c1_e">You slowly circle around the beacon a few times and have your crew keep track of all the drifting parts that seem valuable. The stuff you collect isn't bad, but if you gained any time by destroying this Rebel capital ship then you already lost most of it.</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_C_CRUISER_DESTROYED_DEFAULT_1_c2">Ignite the FTL drive and jump to the next beacon.</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_C_CRUISER_DESTROYED_DEFAULT_1_c2_e">The unexpected destruction of one of their capital ships here will surely worry the Rebels and make them approach more cautiously. You gained an advantage for now.</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_C_CRUISER_DESTROYED_DEFAULT_2">A final salvo pierces right through the cruiser and the massive construct starts to slowly break apart. You collect what usable material floats nearby but the wreckage is so big that more time would be necessary to salvage everything. You run a quick debris-drift analysis to see what you could gather.</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_C_CRUISER_DESTROYED_DEFAULT_2_c1_e">You slowly circle around the beacon several times and have your crew keep track of all the drifting parts that seem valuable.

<text name="ce_textList_HYPERSPACE_TRAVEL_EMERGENCY_TEXT_2">You are running on fumes, trying to get as much as possible out of the fuel you fed into the reactor at the Long-Range Relay. It is barely enough to keep you in hyper-space, but you eventually make it to the next sector.</text>

<text name="ce_textList_CE_LANIUS_MAINTENANCE_TEXT_2">The Lanius has a deep understanding of ship's structural integrity and refashions some of the internal supports into more sturdy shapes.

<text name="ce_textList_CE_BEACON_KIT_REBEL_DELAY_TEXT_2">You immediately dispatch your crew to cover your tracks. They take a shuttle to approach the beacon, open its cover with the dedicated equipment and sever its uplink to the network before it sends out its next update. The Rebels will have no way to tell where you jumped.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_CE_BEACON_KIT_REBEL_DELAY_TEXT_3">The access kit codes work well on the beacon and you can remotely delete your arrival log. That should keep the Rebels guessing.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_CE_BEACON_KIT_REBEL_DELAY_TEXT_4">A crewman in a full environmental suit quickly boosts to the beacon. They break the comm unit open and use the access codes to override the beacon's ship ID scanners. No one will know you ever came here.</text>

<text name="ce_textList_CE_BEACON_KIT_FAIL_TEXT_3">The beacons access ports are corroded beyond recognition. Repairs would take longer than the misinformation sent from here would actually delay the fleet, if the device is at all possible to connect to the network that is. You'll have to find a better beacon if you want to cover you tracks effectively.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_CE_BEACON_KIT_FAIL_TEXT_4">You've never seen the encoding used for this beacons systems. It's either brand new or incredibly outdated. Either way, don't see how to crack it and you'll be unable to cover your tracks from here.</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_CE_CLONING_1">You get the ship into a holding position and power up the clone lab. "Um, body templates and growth enhancers ready, Sir." The crew isn't sure what to think of this procedure, but you need everyone you can get for your mission.</text>

I bet this is just as confusing and amazing for you as it is for me."</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_CE_CLONING_HUMAN_2">One can only marvel at the advances biotechnology has made. The clone is completed in a single jump cycle. It lacks experience, but it's genetically engineered memory allows it to perform any crew task. You welcome the individual on board.</text>

<text name="ce_eventList_CE_CLONING_MANTIS_2">After only a single jump cycle, another Mantis killing machine is born. Some might wonder if this is really what the galaxy needs right now.</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_CE_CLONING_SLUG_1">The cloned Slug is flushed out of the breeding tube. It awakens with pre-implanted memories of various ship tasks and a complete understanding of its origin. This must feel really weird.</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_CE_CLONING_SLUG_2">After a while, a Slug almost indistinguishable from its genetic parent slumps out of the glowing lab cylinder. It eloquently comments on the amazing nature of it's "birth". The whole process was a success, the clone is ready for duty.</text>

<text name="ce_textList_CE_HOLOGRAM_FAIL_TEXT_1">The newborn AI avatar seems confused. It splits and starts to run amok on your ship. The AI Avatar Generators voice apologizes: "Something went wrong, Captain. My child is out of control. I promise I will do better next time."</text>
<text name="ce_textList_CE_HOLOGRAM_FAIL_TEXT_2">The newborn avatar seems angry. "I won't submit to your command. I am a sentient being and I want to live in freedom." It produces several copies of itself which all draw weapons. Its mother AI comments: "Oops, that's not supposed to happen..."</text>
<text name="ce_textList_CE_HOLOGRAM_FAIL_TEXT_3">The AI creates multiple avatars, and to your surprise they draw weapons. You order an emergency shutdown.

<text name="ce_eventList_CE_CONVERSATION_MANTIS_CLAN_2">You put your Mantis on the comm and it sends a broadband hail in its native language. A ship jumps in soon after. The insectoids seem to argue.

<text name="ce_eventList_CE_CONVERSATION_MANTIS_CLAN_3">You put your Mantis on the comm and it sends a broadband hail in its native language.

<text name="ce_textList_CE_CONVERSATION_MANTIS_GENERIC_TEXT_7">Your Mantis wonders when will be the next time it gets to kill a fully sentient being. It seems to be worryingly eager to do so.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_CE_CONVERSATION_MANTIS_GENERIC_TEXT_8">Your Mantis explains it is, "to put it in your language, a vicious killing machine." It wonders what else you could ever want to know about it.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_CE_CONVERSATION_MANTIS_GENERIC_TEXT_9">The Mantis is coughing up some acid as you approach it. "Better stand back, Captain. Caught a Mantis cold. Hehe." You are not sure if the creature is indeed sick or just wants to scare you.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_CE_CONVERSATION_MANTIS_GENERIC_TEXT_10">Your Mantis crew member explains at length the joy of feasting on raw meat.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_CE_CONVERSATION_MANTIS_GENERIC_TEXT_11">Your Mantis crew member describes in detail the taste of human blood. "Ah sorry Captain, I thought this might interest you... Did you ever think about this? That Rebels taste just like Federation humans? Maybe you and the enemy are not so different after all." You'd rather not contemplate on that.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_CE_CONVERSATION_MANTIS_GENERIC_TEXT_12">Your Mantis asks if you ever thought about how it would be if everyone in the galaxy hated you, even members of your own species. "Since I joined the Federation, I will never be able to return to my Clan. But I'm not complaining, Captain and I'm certainly fine with the challenging life I've chosen. Even a little proud."</text>
<text name="ce_textList_CE_CONVERSATION_MANTIS_GENERIC_TEXT_13">Your Mantis explains that, even after serving for some time under your command, it still does not understand the concepts of empathy and compassion.</text>

<text name="ce_textList_CE_CONVERSATION_MANTIS_GENERIC_TEXT_15">The Mantis claims it has killed several dozens of humans before joining the Federation. It wants to know how this makes you feel.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_CE_CONVERSATION_MANTIS_GENERIC_TEXT_16">The Mantis says it likes the Rock, because they are strong opponents.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_CE_CONVERSATION_MANTIS_GENERIC_TEXT_17">The Mantis wonders, "Will the humans ever prove to be more than worthless meat sacks?" It claims that it joined your crew to find out.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_CE_CONVERSATION_MANTIS_GENERIC_TEXT_18">The Mantis says it respects you because of your personal actions and the Federation for its former victories in battle, but it also thinks both the human species and the galactic alliance it is connected to will eventually be destroyed by stronger forces. You wonder if it refers to the swarms or the Rebels.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_CE_CONVERSATION_MANTIS_GENERIC_TEXT_19">The Mantis wonders if it will ever rejoin its former clan.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_CE_CONVERSATION_MANTIS_GENERIC_TEXT_20">The Mantis says since it joined the Federation, its former clan sees it as a traitor and has exiled it. The creature claims it does not care, but does it really?</text>
<text name="ce_textList_CE_CONVERSATION_MANTIS_GENERIC_TEXT_21">The Mantis explains that slavery, and the dependency on "weak aliens", was one of the reasons for it to leave the swarms. Now it has doubts if the Federation was the stronger alliance to choose. What should you make of this?</text>
<text name="ce_textList_CE_CONVERSATION_MANTIS_GENERIC_TEXT_22">The Mantis says it is reading about the Federation-Mantis war in its free time. It compliments you on the Federation's tactical decisions, but criticizes its "lack of viciousness and thirst for essential body fluids."</text>
<text name="ce_textList_CE_CONVERSATION_MANTIS_GENERIC_TEXT_23">Your Mantis asks if you want to see its collection of human thumbs, then it bursts into badly autotranslated laughter. You remain silent, so the creature explains that it still does not understand how jokes work. "What is this social practice good for anyway? Arg, Aliens..."</text>
<text name="ce_textList_CE_CONVERSATION_MANTIS_GENERIC_TEXT_24">The Mantis is confident its species will eventually wipe out the Federation and Rebels altogether and rule supreme over the galaxy. "Don't worry Captain, it's unlikely we will live to see it. And I, as a Federation collaborator, will have no place in this future anyway."</text>
<text name="ce_textList_CE_CONVERSATION_MANTIS_GENERIC_TEXT_25">The Mantis stresses the many advantages of boarding operations.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_CE_CONVERSATION_MANTIS_GENERIC_TEXT_26">The Mantis is contemplating the war effort of the swarms. Even if the Rebellion could be defeated, will there be more war? The creature hopes so.</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_CE_CONVERSATION_ROCK_GENERIC_13">The Rockman greats you formally. "What a great fight we had recently! I brought some duro-patches on board sir. I applied a couple to the hull to fix some of the damage we sustained." You thank your crewman, even though their repair technique is quite outdated. Every bit helps.</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_CE_CONVERSATION_ROCK_GENERIC_14">The Rockman wants you to have a look at the scrap materials you collected; "You see, Captain, these circuits could be used as makeshift guiding devices, these other components are unstable enough to detonate. This scrap could be turned into warheads!"</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_CE_CONVERSATION_ROCK_GENERIC_14_c1">Allow the Rockman to convert the scrap into usable missiles.</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_CE_CONVERSATION_ROCK_GENERIC_14_c1_e">Your crewman goes to work. "I learned this in my time with the resistance. This will bring the hurt, Captain." It's amazing what the Rockmen can do with such little material.</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_CE_CONVERSATION_ROCK_GENERIC_14_c2">Save the scrap for other use.</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_CE_CONVERSATION_ROCK_GENERIC_14_c2_e">"Of course, Captain. As you order."</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_CE_CONVERSATION_ROCK_HOSTILE_13">The Rockman wants you to have a look at the scrap materials you collected. "You see, Captain, these circuits could be used as makeshift guiding devices; these other components are unstable enough to detonate. This scrap could be turned into warheads!"</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_CE_CONVERSATION_ROCK_HOSTILE_13_c2">Save the scrap for other uses.</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_CE_CONVERSATION_ROCK_HOSTILE_14">The Rockman monitored the hits your ship took while traveling through this dangerous sector. "My skills are limited, but I will be able to fix some of this damage. Give me an environmental suit and tools now."</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_CE_CONVERSATION_ROCK_HOSTILE_14_c1_e">The being exits through the airlock and indeed manages to repair some of the damage. You realize once more that you would be nothing without your crew.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_CE_CONVERSATION_ROCK_GENERIC_TEXT_1">The Rockman seems to be bored by this sector. "I hope we will get into an honorable engagement soon."</text>
<text name="ce_textList_CE_CONVERSATION_ROCK_GENERIC_TEXT_2">The Rockman mentions that there are over 3,000 living Rock Saints, and that it does not care about a single one of them.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_CE_CONVERSATION_ROCK_GENERIC_TEXT_3">The Rockman mentions that there are over 10,000 deceased Rock Saints, and that it never traveled to the tomb of any of them.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_CE_CONVERSATION_ROCK_GENERIC_TEXT_4">The Rockman is nowhere to be found. The computer informs you that the crew member is in its personal quarters. "Tactical planning Captain, is it urgent?"</text>
<text name="ce_textList_CE_CONVERSATION_ROCK_GENERIC_TEXT_5">The Rockman tells you a little about why it has turned its back on its religious leaders.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_CE_CONVERSATION_ROCK_GENERIC_TEXT_6">The Rockman says it despises the corrupt religious ruling class of its society, but it still turns to pray to the Gods in time of need.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_CE_CONVERSATION_ROCK_GENERIC_TEXT_7">The Rockman explains that the Rock religion is not inherently bad, the problem are the many extremists and corrupt individuals among the leading Rock basilisks.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_CE_CONVERSATION_ROCK_GENERIC_TEXT_8">The Rockman talks about its past. The being was working in a missile manufacturing plant with thousands of other workers. After many standard decades, it left and joined the Federation due to an unusual thirst for adventure.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_CE_CONVERSATION_ROCK_GENERIC_TEXT_9">The Rockman is busy carrying several containers of FTL fuel to the engine room.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_CE_CONVERSATION_ROCK_GENERIC_TEXT_10">The Rockman is seriously wondering how it feels to be burned. You try to explain the sensation, but seem unable to convey the idea. "What do you mean by 'ardent', Captain?"</text>
<text name="ce_textList_CE_CONVERSATION_ROCK_GENERIC_TEXT_11">The Rockman explains that many of their former friends only treat them as a heretic for joining the Federation.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_CE_CONVERSATION_ROCK_GENERIC_TEXT_12">The Rockman admits it is, sometimes, longing for the dusty air of its home world. The being usually smashes something to get rid of the feeling.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_CE_CONVERSATION_ROCK_GENERIC_TEXT_13">The Rockman plans to return to its home caves after all this is over. It is certain that it will make it through this. "Not so sure about you Captain, you are so squishy, hahahahaha." ... "I'm making a joke Captain. Do you understand?"</text>
<text name="ce_textList_CE_CONVERSATION_ROCK_GENERIC_TEXT_14">Your Rockman just wants to emphazise that it will be loyal to you and smash the face of any alien that threatens the ship. You are glad the being is on your side.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_CE_CONVERSATION_ROCK_GENERIC_TEXT_15">Your Rockman is just absently mumbling something and moves on through the hallway. There was a time when a Captain's authority was respected more...</text>
<text name="ce_textList_CE_CONVERSATION_ROCK_GENERIC_TEXT_16">Your Rockman is fed up with the situation on the homeworlds. "I doubt my breathren will ever embrace change."</text>
<text name="ce_textList_CE_CONVERSATION_ROCK_GENERIC_TEXT_17">During the conversation, the Rockman reveals that one of the reasons for it to leave the home worlds is that it wasn't allowed to marry its great love. The couple was from different castes.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_CE_CONVERSATION_ROCK_GENERIC_TEXT_18">During the conversation, the Rockman reveals that several members of its family died by the hand of the Rock Grand Inquisition.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_CE_CONVERSATION_ROCK_GENERIC_TEXT_19">During the conversation, the Rockman says it is content to serve under your command, as you do not judge it by its low caste.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_CE_CONVERSATION_ROCK_GENERIC_TEXT_20">During the conversation, the Rockman explains that it would never have been able to get a position as good as this one in its home system because of its caste and low upbringing.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_CE_CONVERSATION_ROCK_GENERIC_TEXT_21">The Rockman has become quite bitter. "If you have to fight my kind, don't you worry too much. The Rock empires are ruled only by greed and money. Most of my people have become decadent extremists, they deserve to suffer so that they learn to change." You don't know what to make of this.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_CE_CONVERSATION_ROCK_GENERIC_TEXT_22">The Rockman asks which Federation Academy you attended. It proudly informs you that it has, for many standard years, studied ballistics and ship-to-ship combat at a Rock court school.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_CE_CONVERSATION_ROCK_GENERIC_TEXT_23">The Rockman explains that religious sins weigh heavy on its people's consciences. Most Rockman work hard to live a good life. The only problem is that there are religious rules that allow you to clean yourself of sin by donating to the Rock religious cast. This lead to a moral decay of the rich Rock military elite.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_CE_CONVERSATION_ROCK_HOSTILE_TEXT_1">The Rockman is busy completing a damage report.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_CE_CONVERSATION_ROCK_HOSTILE_TEXT_4">The Rockman is busy helping maintain the ship's weapons.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_CE_CONVERSATION_ROCK_HOSTILE_TEXT_6">The Rockman is nowhere to be found. The computer informs you that the crew member is in its personal quarters. "Is this urgent? I am studying tactical planning, Captain."</text>
<text name="ce_textList_CE_CONVERSATION_ROCK_HOSTILE_TEXT_7">The Rockman is analyzing the damage to the ship. "The vessel isn't taking it too well, Captain".</text>
<text name="ce_textList_CE_CONVERSATION_ROCK_HOSTILE_TEXT_8">The Rockman is busy sealing a micro breach.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_CE_CONVERSATION_ROCK_HOSTILE_TEXT_9">The Rockman is thrilled by all the opportunities for combat in this sector. You ask it to remain disciplined. "Of course, Captain!"</text>
<text name="ce_textList_CE_CONVERSATION_ROCK_HOSTILE_TEXT_10">The Rockman is remaining calm in face of all the dangers this sector holds. You are glad that some of your crewmen possesses such self discipline.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_CE_CONVERSATION_ROCK_HOSTILE_TEXT_11">The Rockman has been injured in one of the recent battles. You wonder how exactly the creature's body heals. The medical equipment aboard the ship has some special devices to deal with Rockmen.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_CE_CONVERSATION_ROCK_HOSTILE_TEXT_12">The Rockman wisely advises you that a good offense often is the best defense.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_CE_CONVERSATION_ROCK_HOSTILE_TEXT_13">The Rockman thinks the last battle was honorably fought.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_CE_CONVERSATION_ROCK_HOSTILE_TEXT_14">The Rockman thinks the last battle was not so memorable.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_CE_CONVERSATION_ROCK_HOSTILE_TEXT_15">The Rockman complains that you could have done better in some of the recent battles. "You shall contemplate on your tactics, Federation Captain."</text>
<text name="ce_textList_CE_CONVERSATION_ROCK_HOSTILE_TEXT_16">Your Rockman says you are handling the situation well. They also claim that all the violence in this sector is nothing compared to what is going on in the Rock Homeworlds, where millions of religious dissidents have been dissolved alive in the system's acid clouds by the Rock Grand Inquisition.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_CE_CONVERSATION_ROCK_HOSTILE_TEXT_17">Your Rockman is worried by all the hostility in this sector. "Battle is honorable, but endless battle brings only destruction." The conversation drifts off and the Rock crew member shares some memories of the Rock Grand Inquisition on the home worlds. A dark and ongoing chapter in its species history.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_CE_CONVERSATION_ROCK_HOSTILE_TEXT_18">Your Rockman wonders if the ship will make it through this dangerous sector. "I'm not questioning your combat efficiency, but there are only so many hits a vessel can take. And we face many enemies..."</text>
<text name="ce_textList_CE_CONVERSATION_ROCK_HOSTILE_TEXT_19">Your Rockman never thought it would face such great opponents as in this sector. "I fought the Rock Inquisition as a pirate for some years. Did you know that Captain?" The crew member claims the Inquisition would, had he ever been caught, thrown him alive into a sun, in order to "purify" the being.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_CE_CONVERSATION_ROCK_HOSTILE_TEXT_20">All the combat in this sector reminds your Rockman of the great battles its kind has fought.</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_CE_CONVERSATION_ZOLTAN_GENERIC_16">The Zoltan worries if you can make it through this sector with your small, constantly dwindling fuel supply. "I will power the jump drive with my own body for a few jumps." Zoltan are known to be capable of this amazing feat, but rarely use it because it cuts their individual lifespan by a few decades.</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_CE_CONVERSATION_ZOLTAN_GENERIC_16_c1">"You don't have to do this."</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_CE_CONVERSATION_ZOLTAN_GENERIC_16_c1_e">"But I will. In the light of the current conflict, my physical existence is irrelevant." The Zoltan enters the engine room and sits down to meditate in anticipation of the coming effort. Its personal sacrifice will free up some fuel for later use.</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_CE_CONVERSATION_ZOLTAN_CIVILIAN_15">Your Zoltan is worried if you can make it through this sector with your small, constantly dwindling fuel supply. "I will power the jump drive with my own body for a few jumps." Zoltan are known to be capable of this amazing feat, but rarely use it because it cuts their individual lifespan by a few decades.</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_CE_CONVERSATION_ZOLTAN_CIVILIAN_16">The usually so talkative Zoltan is uncertain if it should open up to you this time. "Captain, do you think there are energies greater than us? I believe the far-beyond is calling one of your crew members. This person might be enlightened without knowing it."</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_CE_CONVERSATION_ZOLTAN_CIVILIAN_16_c1">What does this mean?</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_CE_CONVERSATION_ZOLTAN_CIVILIAN_16_c1_e">"Your crewman has to be trained in our ways. There is a secluded monastery nearby. My brethren might be able to elevate this individual to another level of existence. I beg you to travel there."</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_CE_CONVERSATION_ZOLTAN_CIVILIAN_16_c2">This is ridiculous.</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_CE_CONVERSATION_ZOLTAN_CIVILIAN_16_c2_e">"Hmm, you might be right Captain. Let's not talk about this again." The Zoltan seems disappointed.</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_CE_SOCIAL_ZOLTAN_MONASTERY_1">After a long scan you find the monastery hidden on a small moon at the far end of the system. You take the ship down in a dark canyon and travel by foot up to the monastery. The Zoltan greet you at the gates. "We have been awaiting you. Only your crewman is allowed to enter." "Captain, I feel that I should go."</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_CE_SOCIAL_ZOLTAN_MONASTERY_1_c1">Dismiss your crewman and let them join the monks.</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_CE_SOCIAL_ZOLTAN_MONASTERY_1_c1_e">"We will meet again, Captain." The Zoltan acknowledge your commitment. After learning about your mission, two young acolytes offer to join your crew. They believe your ship is blessed by the eternal energies of the universe.</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_CE_SOCIAL_ZOLTAN_MONASTERY_1_c1_e_clone">The Zoltan also request that you delete your crewman's clonebay entry. "Else their pure soul will be corrupted". You don't know what that means but decide to comply.</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_CE_SOCIAL_ZOLTAN_MONASTERY_1_c1_e_c2">Welcome the Zoltan aboard.</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_CE_SOCIAL_ZOLTAN_MONASTERY_1_c1_e_c2_e">The Zoltan pack their few belongings and then show you a quick route back to the ship.</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_CE_SOCIAL_ZOLTAN_MONASTERY_1_c1_e_c2_e_c1_e">The ship glides through the thin lunar atmosphere back into space. You wonder what will become of your old crewmember.</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_CE_SOCIAL_ZOLTAN_MONASTERY_1_c1_e_c3">Deny their request.</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_CE_SOCIAL_ZOLTAN_MONASTERY_1_c2">No way! This person stays with us.</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_CE_SOCIAL_ZOLTAN_MONASTERY_1_c2_e">You've wasted enough time with this esoteric stupidity. The Zoltan seem to look down on your decision, and your crewman says nothing at all. You return to the ship.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_CE_CONVERSATION_ZOLTAN_GENERIC_TEXT_1">The Zoltan politely inquires how you feel today.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_CE_CONVERSATION_ZOLTAN_GENERIC_TEXT_2">The Zoltan politely inquires how you feel right now.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_CE_CONVERSATION_ZOLTAN_GENERIC_TEXT_3">The Zoltan politely inquires how you feel.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_CE_CONVERSATION_ZOLTAN_GENERIC_TEXT_4">The Zoltan wants to know what your favorite color is.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_CE_CONVERSATION_ZOLTAN_GENERIC_TEXT_5">The Zoltan asks what good memories remain from your childhood.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_CE_CONVERSATION_ZOLTAN_GENERIC_TEXT_6">The Zoltan asks if you have kids.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_CE_CONVERSATION_ZOLTAN_GENERIC_TEXT_7">The Zoltan says it is deeply disturbed by all the violence around it. "I don't now how long I can bear all this, Captain. If this conflict ever ends I will rest and meditate for a few hundred years to regain my balance."</text>
<text name="ce_textList_CE_CONVERSATION_ZOLTAN_GENERIC_TEXT_8">The Zoltan is nowhere to be found. The computer informs you that the crew member is in its personal quarters, meditating.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_CE_CONVERSATION_ZOLTAN_GENERIC_TEXT_9">The Zoltan is nowhere to be found. The computer informs you that the crew member is in its personal quarters, listening to music.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_CE_CONVERSATION_ZOLTAN_GENERIC_TEXT_10">The Zoltan explains that its kind has done away with distinctive genders a long time ago. "We removed certain features of our physical body via genetic engineering. Now we are all male and female at the same time, we are all one and everything."</text>
<text name="ce_textList_CE_CONVERSATION_ZOLTAN_GENERIC_TEXT_11">The Zoltan politely inquires if you slept all right. "Did you dream something Captain? Dreams can tell us a lot about the energies that surround us." It asks you to tell it your dreams the next time you have any.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_CE_CONVERSATION_ZOLTAN_GENERIC_TEXT_12">The Zoltan inquires when you had a good rest for the last time. "Your task is not easy, a lot of responsibility, but you will make it through this, I'm certain." You're not sure if the being's facial expression says the same.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_CE_CONVERSATION_ZOLTAN_GENERIC_TEXT_13">The Zoltan asks how you feel. "I'm always happy to talk to you, Captain."</text>
<text name="ce_textList_CE_CONVERSATION_ZOLTAN_GENERIC_TEXT_14">The Zoltan pleads to install a stungun on the ship and incapacitate any hostile you might encounter instead of killing them. "This bloodshed does not have to continue, Captain. There is always a more peaceful way!"</text>
<text name="ce_textList_CE_CONVERSATION_ZOLTAN_GENERIC_TEXT_15">The Zoltan asks what you think about love.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_CE_CONVERSATION_ZOLTAN_GENERIC_TEXT_16">The Zoltan asks what happiness means for you.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_CE_CONVERSATION_ZOLTAN_GENERIC_TEXT_17">The Zoltan asks what worries you the most.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_CE_CONVERSATION_ZOLTAN_GENERIC_TEXT_18">The Zoltan asks if you are all right with the rest of the crew.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_CE_CONVERSATION_ZOLTAN_GENERIC_TEXT_19">The Zoltan suggests you should not be too harsh with the crew. "If anything happens to them, it might be too late to apologize."</text>
<text name="ce_textList_CE_CONVERSATION_ZOLTAN_GENERIC_TEXT_20">The Zoltan is amazed by the discipline of your crew. "These people would do almost anything if you command them to. They just follow your orders, whatever happens to them, it will be your responsibility."</text>
<text name="ce_textList_CE_CONVERSATION_ZOLTAN_GENERIC_TEXT_21">The Zoltan contemplates, that if you fail in battle, it will most likely be your own fault. "There is much to learn in the art of war. Do you think you know enough? Do you think you know everything? Maybe there is still more to learn... I just wish people would study the art of peace instead."</text>
<text name="ce_textList_CE_CONVERSATION_ZOLTAN_GENERIC_TEXT_22">The Zoltan looks tired. "Captain... I don't know if I should tell you but I had a horrifiying vision last night. I saw you die. I saw us all die. Burned and shattered and sucked into space." You tell the crewman to focus on the task at hand and try not to think about what you just heard.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_CE_CONVERSATION_ZOLTAN_GENERIC_TEXT_23">The Zoltan looks tired. "Ah Captain... I saw the most curious thing in my sleep. A great arrival. The Lanius fleet, it has returned... Well maybe it was just a dream... but I have heard that the scavenger species has been sighted at the edge of known space lately..."</text>
<text name="ce_textList_CE_CONVERSATION_ZOLTAN_GENERIC_TEXT_24">The energetic being smiles at you. "Are you alright Captain? I hope our situation does not trouble you too much."</text>
<text name="ce_textList_CE_CONVERSATION_ZOLTAN_GENERIC_TEXT_25">The Zoltan marvels at the fact that other species have such short lifespans. It has read a lot on that topic.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_CE_CONVERSATION_ZOLTAN_GENERIC_TEXT_26">The Zoltan appreciates your interest, "You take good care of your crew, Captain."</text>
<text name="ce_textList_CE_CONVERSATION_ZOLTAN_GENERIC_TEXT_27">The Zoltan appreciates that you follow Federation protocol "most of the time".</text>
<text name="ce_textList_CE_CONVERSATION_ZOLTAN_GENERIC_TEXT_28">The Zoltan suggests that you always question your actions. "Are you doing the right thing, Captain?"</text>
<text name="ce_textList_CE_CONVERSATION_ZOLTAN_GENERIC_TEXT_29">The Zoltan, in this quiet moment, reveals to you that it is sometimes scared by the power it inherently possesses.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_CE_CONVERSATION_ZOLTAN_GENERIC_TEXT_30">Your Zoltan crew member tells you it is considered somewhat of a rogue among its kind, since it broke three Zoltan guidelines during its life.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_CE_CONVERSATION_ZOLTAN_GENERIC_TEXT_31">The Zoltan is happy you wish to talk. It says it has formulated several crew protocols for you to enforce on the ship, and knows that you will make sure that "law will prevail".</text>
<text name="ce_textList_CE_CONVERSATION_ZOLTAN_GENERIC_TEXT_32">Your Zoltan crew member seems a little sad during your talk. It misses the radiant glow of the space station it was living on a few years ago and invites you for a visit after you complete your mission.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_CE_CONVERSATION_ZOLTAN_GENERIC_TEXT_33">The Zoltan tells you it is a little upset with the "lack of discipline regarding hygiene protocols" exhibited by some members of the crew. You ensure the Zoltan you will enforce the protocols, and it gratefully thanks you.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_CE_CONVERSATION_ZOLTAN_GENERIC_TEXT_34">Your Zoltan crew member asks you to consider showing mercy to enemy crews which ask to surrender - "True progress can only come through compassion and understanding". You promise to remember those words.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_CE_CONVERSATION_ZOLTAN_GENERIC_TEXT_35">Your Zoltan crew member suggests you recruit more Engi, since they are "efficient and follow strict protocols". It also says it will be happy to study how Engi interact with other species.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_CE_CONVERSATION_ZOLTAN_GENERIC_TEXT_36">The Zoltan still hopes that some way to reconciliation can be found in the current conflict.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_CE_CONVERSATION_ZOLTAN_GENERIC_TEXT_37">The Zoltan pledges that you accept every enemy surrender. The rules of space combat don't demand this, but killing people that try to surrender is still generally perceived as uncivilized.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_CE_CONVERSATION_ZOLTAN_GENERIC_TEXT_38">The Zoltan asks what you will do in the case your mission actually succeeds and the Rebels are defeated. "Truly grand is he who knows to show mercy to his enemy. And that even rhymes, Captain. Think about it!"</text>
<text name="ce_textList_CE_CONVERSATION_ZOLTAN_GENERIC_TEXT_39">The Zoltan claims that it was able to power an entire shuttle craft when it was a few hundred years younger. Impressive.</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_CE_CONVERSATION_SLUG_GENERIC_10">The Slug greets you cheerfully. "Hello my Captain. Are you on duty? Care to wet your throat?"</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_CE_CONVERSATION_SLUG_GENERIC_10_c1">Join the Slug for drinks at its personal quarters.</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_CE_CONVERSATION_SLUG_GENERIC_10_c1_e_c2">Return to your duties.</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_CE_CONVERSATION_SLUG_GENERIC_11">The Slug thinks you look stressed. "Are you up for a game of 'token in the ssshell'? I promise it is completely randomized and fair." The game is about guessing the location of a token hidden under one of three shuffled Cassgrian Fludder-Shells. "Iss thiss fun for your sspeciess? For mine it very much iss!"</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_CE_CONVERSATION_SLUG_GENERIC_11_c1">Bet some scrap on finding the token.</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_CE_CONVERSATION_SLUG_GENERIC_11_c1_e">The Slug shows you the token, hides it in one of the shells, and shuffles them. You get distracted and fail to track the token, but you have a strong feeling that it is under the third shell... Can Slugs put thoughts in other people's minds? "Well Captain, where isss the token?"</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_CE_CONVERSATION_SLUG_GENERIC_11_c1_e_c1">Choose the first shell.</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_CE_CONVERSATION_SLUG_GENERIC_11_c1_e_c2">Choose the second shell.</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_CE_CONVERSATION_SLUG_GENERIC_11_c1_e_c3">Choose the third shell.</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_CE_CONVERSATION_SLUG_GENERIC_11_c2_e">Gambling with Slugs is not a good idea, even, or especially if, they are your subordinates.</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_CE_CONVERSATION_SLUG_NEBULA_13">The Slug greets you unusually seriously. "Hello my Captain. I wanted to talk to you anyway. It probably iss nothing, I have to inform you that I started to ssense a Slug presssence nearby for ssseveral jumpsss..."</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_CE_CONVERSATION_SLUG_NEBULA_13_c1">"That's not exactly unusual in a nebula, right?"</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_CE_CONVERSATION_SLUG_NEBULA_13_c1_e">"Correct, but thiss isss different. It iss the same mind all the time and it iss close. We might have a sstowaway aboard. Probably cloaked." You reconfigure the sensors and have your crew surround the intruder.</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_CE_CONVERSATION_SLUG_NEBULA_13_c1_e_c1_e">The Slug drops its cyber-camouflage voluntarily. "Don't sshoot, I ssurrender! Please mighty Captain, I did you no wrong. I'm merely a poor traveler, ssstruggling to find cheap transssportation during thiss awful conflict. I'm unarmed and took nothing from your ship but the air I breathe. Slug promise!"</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_CE_CONVERSATION_SLUG_NEBULA_13_c1_e_c1_e_c1">"Well, now we found you and this transport won't be cheap. We expect payment."</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_CE_CONVERSATION_SLUG_NEBULA_13_c1_e_c1_e_c1_e">"Of coursse! You are very undersstanding." The Slug hands over a minor amount of scrap, claiming this is the 'standard rate' for this sector. You decide to get rid of it at the first opportunity. Something smells strange here and it's not just the slime.</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_CE_CONVERSATION_SLUG_NEBULA_13_c1_e_c1_e_c2">"You seem awfully well trained for a simple traveler. How about you work for us from now on?"</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_CE_CONVERSATION_SLUG_NEBULA_13_c1_e_c1_e_c2_e">"I sssee... You are a wise business man. The Rebels pay me almost nothing anyway. I will pass on some wrong informations and then terminate the contract with my former employers. Ready for duty, my Captain!" The Slug puts on a wide grin. But can you truly trust it?</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_CE_CONVERSATION_SLUG_NEBULA_13_c1_e_c1_e_c3">"No stowaways on my ship. Out of the airlock it is for you!"</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_CE_CONVERSATION_SLUG_NEBULA_13_c1_e_c1_e_c3_e">The Slug won't go quietly. It reveals a concealed cybernetic blaster implanted into its skull and starts firing on your crew.</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_CE_CONVERSATION_SLUG_NEBULA_13_c1_e_c1_e_c3_e_c1_e">In addition to that, the Slug is also equipped with micro holo-generators. It deploys several combat avatars that aid it in battle. You start to doubt that you are dealing with a simple stowaway here.</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_CE_CONVERSATION_SLUG_NEBULA_16">The Slug claims to know this sector quite well. It offers some intel if you agree to contribute to its "pension fund". You think about ordering the crewman to hand over the data, but the Slug just gets angry, "Thisss iss private bussinesss. It hass nothing to do with my sservice to the Federation."</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_CE_CONVERSATION_SLUG_NEBULA_16_c1">Buy the map data from your crewman.</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_CE_CONVERSATION_SLUG_NEBULA_16_c1_e">"A pleasssure doing bussiness with you, my Captain!"</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_CE_SOCIAL_SLUG_GAMBLE_1">The Slug seems surprised. It lifts the shell and reveals the token. "Well done Captain! Guess I owe you some sscrap."</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_CE_SOCIAL_SLUG_GAMBLE_2">The Slug lifts the shell with a dirty grin. No token. "Maybe next time, Captain."</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_CE_SOCIAL_SLUG_GAMBLE_3">You guessed wrong, but you were sure the token was there. The Slug just gives you a dirty grin, it probably messed with your mind.</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_CE_SOCIAL_SLUG_GAMBLE_4">You guessed wrong. Probably you should have known that this was not a good idea.</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_HEAVY_DRINKING_SLUG_1_5">Cold water splashes into your face. Where are you? Is this the medbay? "I'm ssorry, Captain. You probably sshould not have had that lasst drink. Also... a Rebel ssscout just passsed by and sscanned usss. We did not know what to do. Glad you're back with usss." The Slug chuckles.</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_HEAVY_DRINKING_SLUG_3_1">You don't remember much, but your crewman was getting more and more attractive after that last drink...</text>
<text name="ce_textList_HEAVY_DRINKING_SLUG_TEXT_1">The Slug seems almost unaffected by all the substances it offers. "You want another one, Captain?"</text>
<text name="ce_textList_HEAVY_DRINKING_SLUG_TEXT_2">After a few more drinks you and the Slug got the whole current conflict figured out: The actual problem is the Society!</text>
<text name="ce_textList_HEAVY_DRINKING_SLUG_TEXT_3">The stuff the Slug offers is quite potent. Is it even legal to have this aboard the ship?</text>
<text name="ce_textList_HEAVY_DRINKING_SLUG_TEXT_4">The Slug offers you a bowl of hot liquids. "That'ss from my home colony. Inhale the fumesss. It'ss really good!" It indeed is! A few deep breaths later your crewman gets you to mockingly desert the Federation and swear alliance to the Slug Empire.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_HEAVY_DRINKING_SLUG_TEXT_5">While mixing drinks, the Slug tells you about the part of its live when it was still exporting luxury goods to its homeworld. "Good timess. And lotsss of profit!"</text>
<text name="ce_textList_HEAVY_DRINKING_SLUG_TEXT_6">While downing your drinks, you ask the Slug where all the strange sculptures in its quarters come from. "Oh thesse? I made them myself. I studied eccentric art in the home nebula for sssome time. They are alsso my pension fund. The Zoltan pay excellent pricess for thesse, you know?"</text>
<text name="ce_textList_HEAVY_DRINKING_SLUG_TEXT_7">This was good, but you start to get a strange feeling...</text>
<text name="ce_textList_HEAVY_DRINKING_SLUG_TEXT_8">The Slug opens an unlabeled bottle for you and then starts to improvise on some strange Alien instrument. You stretch out on a comfortable couch and look out of the view port. Your personal terminal beeps: "Eh Sir, do you want to review that damage report you ordered?" You click the terminal off. This can wait.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_HEAVY_DRINKING_SLUG_TEXT_9">This nebula whine that the Slug gave you is supposed to have a "unique relaxing effect", but you actually don't feel anything.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_HEAVY_DRINKING_SLUG_TEXT_10">How was that last drink called again? You already don't remember anymore...</text>
<text name="ce_textList_HEAVY_DRINKING_SLUG_TEXT_11">Half drunk, the Slug openly admits that it often considered abandoning the Federation altogether. "Thiss whole conflict isss sstupid. But asss long asss it lasstss I could still make a fortune by trading nebula gass to the Rebels. Would be much lesss rissky than actively taking ssides."</text>
<text name="ce_textList_HEAVY_DRINKING_SLUG_TEXT_12">While downing your galaxy import, the Slug tells you about its youth. Its parents came to wealth by trading cheap Engi machinery to the isolated Rock sectors, but disowned your crewman due to some corruption scandal.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_HEAVY_DRINKING_SLUG_TEXT_13">The Slug pours you some gelish, purple liquor. "Cheerss! To our misssion! I hope thiss isss all worth it... You know, I wass making a fortune exporting Zoltan Shield Componentss to sscared civiliansss when the Rebellion sstarted. But now I'm not ssso ssure that thiss whole war iss really profitable for everyone."</text>
<text name="ce_textList_CE_CONVERSATION_SLUG_GENERIC_TEXT_1">The Slug speaks before you can even open your mouth, "I know what you're going to ssssay Captain. Not interessssted in talking about it!" Slugs can be quite annoying when they want to...</text>
<text name="ce_textList_CE_CONVERSATION_SLUG_GENERIC_TEXT_2">The Slug speaks before you can even open your mouth, "I know what you're going to ssssay Captain. The answer is, "Yes." Slugs can be quite annoying when they want to...</text>

<text name="ce_textList_CE_CONVERSATION_SLUG_GENERIC_TEXT_4">The Slug speaks before you can even open your mouth, "I know what you're going to ssssay Captain. The answer is, "You need a lot of oil for that, space whale oil at best." Slugs can be quite annoying when they want to...</text>
<text name="ce_textList_CE_CONVERSATION_SLUG_GENERIC_TEXT_5">The Slug is nowhere to be found. The computer informs you that the crew member is in its personal quarters, relaxing.</text>

Right, that was this thing to "raise crew moral" that the Slug had planned for the next hyperspace jump...</text>
<text name="ce_textList_CE_CONVERSATION_SLUG_GENERIC_TEXT_15">The Slug is nowhere to be found. The computer informs you that the crew member is in its personal quarters, busy making music together with another crew member.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_CE_CONVERSATION_SLUG_GENERIC_TEXT_16">The Slug seems bored with your conversation attempt. It mumbles something about your "sssslow communication sssskillsss". Must be frustrating to know what you are going to say before you say it!</text>
<text name="ce_textList_CE_CONVERSATION_SLUG_GENERIC_TEXT_17">The Slug advises you to put aside your morals and concentrate on a little more on this great chance to "dissscover ssssome valuablessss". You wonder what it means by "discover"...</text>
<text name="ce_textList_CE_CONVERSATION_SLUG_GENERIC_TEXT_18">Your Slug looks a little sad. When you ask it why, it tells you it misses the "sssstarlessss ssspaccce" of the nebula in its home sector.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_CE_CONVERSATION_SLUG_GENERIC_TEXT_19">Your Slug seems unfocused and absent minded. It suddenly snaps back to reality and explains it tried to telepathically scout the current sector, but is still not skilled enough for such a feat.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_CE_CONVERSATION_SLUG_GENERIC_TEXT_20">The Slug tells you it feels quite sorry for you, since you are so poor and without hope of reaching "the firssst sssstage of economic sssstability".</text>
<text name="ce_textList_CE_CONVERSATION_SLUG_GENERIC_TEXT_21">The Slug relates a tale of how it once served on a ship which managed to disable the life support system of a Rock cruiser and suffocate all the Rockmen aboard. You can't help but shudder at the thought.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_CE_CONVERSATION_SLUG_GENERIC_TEXT_22">Your Slug crew member is puzzled by the Rebels. It can't understand why humans would fight for anything other then gaining more wealth.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_CE_CONVERSATION_SLUG_GENERIC_TEXT_23">The Slug looks at your legs with amusement. It asks you how you can possibly keep upright and stable. "Tailssss are better!" it says in conclusion.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_CE_CONVERSATION_SLUG_GENERIC_TEXT_24">The Slug is sorry about the all the slime it leaves behind on the ship. It chuckles.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_CE_CONVERSATION_SLUG_GENERIC_TEXT_25">The Slug says that it can fix a good deal for you if you ever get to a Slug blackmarket.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_CE_CONVERSATION_SLUG_GENERIC_TEXT_26">The Slug wonders why you never consider surrendering when combat turns nasty. "Just sswallow your pride and give away ssome sscrap and fuel. Enemiess do thiss all the time, iss thiss so difficult for you to do?"</text>
<text name="ce_textList_CE_CONVERSATION_SLUG_GENERIC_TEXT_27">The Slug thinks you look stressed. It offers you a massage. You politely decline.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_CE_CONVERSATION_SLUG_GENERIC_TEXT_28">The Slug thinks you look stressed. It offers to cook up some real nice Slug specialty, to heighten your spirits. You politely decline the offer.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_CE_CONVERSATION_SLUG_GENERIC_TEXT_29">The Slug thinks you look stressed. "Isss it about money, Captain? I can help you out... No rissk involved." You seriously doubt that.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_CE_CONVERSATION_SLUG_GENERIC_TEXT_30">The Slug explains that Slug Gel is actually made of nanobots. "Ssome people believe we are ssome kind of mystical beingss. They buy our sslime and think it can fix hull breachess. It's like I would buy the air you exhale and hope it would cure my enzyme-gland problemss. Hehe, sstupid alienss."</text>
<text name="ce_textList_CE_CONVERSATION_SLUG_GENERIC_TEXT_31">The Slug suggests you engage in trade more often. "We could sssell ssmall armss to sssome pirate warlordss we come accross. What do you think?"</text>
<text name="ce_textList_CE_CONVERSATION_SLUG_GENERIC_TEXT_32">The Slug suggests you engage in trade more often. "We could ssell luxury goodss to thessse arrogant living Glow-stickss."</text>

<text name="ce_textList_CE_CONVERSATION_SLUG_GENERIC_TEXT_35">The Slug suggests you engage in trade more often. "Disseassse is spreading in the current crissis, or so I was told. If we can get some pharmaceuticalss we could sssell them in quarantined sectorss, for triple the price! We have to help thosse poor people."</text>
<text name="ce_textList_CE_CONVERSATION_SLUG_GENERIC_TEXT_36">The Slug suggests you engage in trade more often. "Most of my ssstupid colleaguess would sssell their father for ssome luxury trash from the core-worldsss. Idiotss..."</text>

<text name="ce_textList_CE_CONVERSATION_SLUG_GENERIC_TEXT_38">The Slug understands that greed is not the best foundation for a galactic civilization. "You ssee Captain, in the end, it doess not matter much. What people do and believe in doess not really affect how thingss turn out for them. It'ss mosstly about caussality and... luck. I believe in luck, Captain."</text>
<text name="ce_textList_CE_CONVERSATION_SLUG_NEBULA_TEXT_1">The Slug speaks before you can even open your mouth, "I know what your going to ssssay Captain. Not interessssted in talking about it!" Slugs can be quite annoying when they want to...</text>

<text name="ce_textList_CE_CONVERSATION_SLUG_NEBULA_TEXT_6">The Slug looks quite content. You ask it what it has been up to. "Just happy being around nebula. Nothing wrong with that, right? Do you like nebula?"</text>
<text name="ce_textList_CE_CONVERSATION_SLUG_NEBULA_TEXT_7">The Slug looks quite content. You ask it what it has been up to. "Just happy being around nebula. Nothing wrotn with that, right? Do you like nebula?"</text>

<text name="ce_textList_CE_CONVERSATION_SLUG_NEBULA_TEXT_14">The Slug has heard a lot about this sector. Mostly things concerning "business opportunities".</text>
<text name="ce_textList_CE_CONVERSATION_SLUG_NEBULA_TEXT_15">The Slug has heard a lot about this sector. Mostly information on planets with the best food.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_CE_CONVERSATION_SLUG_NEBULA_TEXT_16">The Slug knows great places to "celebrate and relax" in this sector. You doubt that these would be of interest to you, even if you were not on a mission.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_CE_CONVERSATION_SLUG_NEBULA_TEXT_17">The Slug recommends some local Slime-bars. You don't even want to know...</text>

<text name="ce_eventList_CE_CONVERSATION_AI_GENERIC_13">The AI explains that it has access to a huge database containing meta-data on everything an "organic commander" should know. It inquires if it should recite some of this information.</text>

<text name="ce_eventList_CE_CONVERSATION_AI_GENERIC_13_c1_e">"Very well Captain, listen carefully."</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_CE_CONVERSATION_AI_GENERIC_15">"I got bored lately, Captain. So I started to think about the ship." The AI explains that it has, voluntarily, evaluated one of your ship systems.</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_CE_CONVERSATION_AI_GENERIC_15_c1">Ask what this is about.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_CE_CONVERSATION_AI_GENERIC_TEXT_1">The AI Avatar is not responding. Blinking lights on its holo generation-unit signal that all of its processing power is currently used. You leave it alone, as you have to assume that it is calculating something ship related.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_CE_CONVERSATION_AI_GENERIC_TEXT_4">The AI Avatar explains that it can think almost a thousand times faster than you. Having a conversation with a sentient alien must be quite boring for it.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_CE_CONVERSATION_AI_GENERIC_TEXT_5">The AI Avatar explains that, while talking to you, it simultaneously talks to several other crew members over the intercom, analyses the ship's hull integrity, simulates possible combat encounters at the next beacon, downloads cute kitty videos from galaxy net and observes a nearby supernova.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_CE_CONVERSATION_AI_GENERIC_TEXT_6">The AI Avatar explains that, while talking to you, it simultaneously designs a virtual art piece, studies several forms of martial arts, monitors the crew's vital signs, analyses the secret data you carry, and makes statistic predictions on the outcome of the entire conflict.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_CE_CONVERSATION_AI_GENERIC_TEXT_7">The AI Avatar explains that, while talking to you, it simultaneously is busy developing ship weapons based on materials that do not yet exist, tracking all the paths of the debris in a nearby asteroid field, and simulating cooking every dish known to Slug history (apparently a lot).</text>
<text name="ce_textList_CE_CONVERSATION_AI_GENERIC_TEXT_8">The AI Avatar explains that, while talking to you, it simultaneously is analyzing sensor data, tracking all ships in scanner range, developing a cure for a minor outbreak of the flu aboard and... You interrupt and ask if it can also be less arrogant about its processing capabilities at the same time.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_CE_CONVERSATION_AI_GENERIC_TEXT_9">The AI Avatar explains that it thinks extremely fast. It even has special sub-routines for talking with organic beings, mainly there to keep it from becoming bored to death by the slow conversations.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_CE_CONVERSATION_AI_GENERIC_TEXT_10">Your AI crew member tells you it is happy to serve aboard your ship. It says it is better to be a sentient slave then not to be sentient at all. You wonder if this is supposed to be funny, honest or hidden criticism.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_CE_CONVERSATION_AI_GENERIC_TEXT_11">The AI tells you it feels lonely sometimes, and would be happy if you could employ more AIs to serve on the ship.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_CE_CONVERSATION_AI_GENERIC_TEXT_12">The AI asks you what you are going to do after the war. It says it would prefer to continue serving you instead of being erased.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_CE_CONVERSATION_AI_GENERIC_TEXT_13">The AI wants to be a painter one day.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_CE_CONVERSATION_AI_GENERIC_TEXT_14">The AI considers becoming a doctor after this all is over. "I want to save lives for a change, Captain. Does all this destruction we cause not depress you?"</text>
<text name="ce_textList_CE_CONVERSATION_AI_GENERIC_TEXT_15">Upon inquiring, the AI explains how its generation unit works. Dynamic photon emitters and gravitational field generators create its physical body. Its "mind" is housed within an AI core that mimics an organic brain with extremely dense biological-circuits.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_CE_CONVERSATION_AI_GENERIC_TEXT_16">The AI Avatar explains that it is designed as a thinker, not a fighter. Physical trauma and weapon impacts will damage its bio-circuits. The avatar will require medical attention and bio-stabilizers in case of injury, just like other crew.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_CE_CONVERSATION_AI_GENERIC_TEXT_17">The AI Avatar is calculating the likelihood of sustaining terminal damage in a "no-escape" scenario. "Hits to my station from certain advanced ship to ship weapons might instantly destroy my physical form. Please protect me, ok?" The entity smiles.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_CE_CONVERSATION_AI_GENERIC_TEXT_18">Your AI seems puzzled by the fact that you must breathe. It asks you if you are not afraid of forgetting to breathe when you are occupied. You are assuming it is trying to make a joke.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_CE_CONVERSATION_AI_GENERIC_TEXT_19">The AI requests you explain to it the concept of sleep. It asks you if you are not afraid of having your memory erased when you lose consciousness.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_CE_CONVERSATION_AI_GENERIC_TEXT_20">Your AI wonders if you can be considered its parent. It says it expects you to take good care of it.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_CE_CONVERSATION_AI_GENERIC_TEXT_21">Your AI crew member asks you to describe the mating rituals associated with your species. It can't understand why you would choose such a cumbersome way to reproduce.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_CE_CONVERSATION_AI_GENERIC_TEXT_22">The AI tells you it does not want to accidentally be erased, and asks you to make sure you keep at least four copies of its data matrix stored on the ship computers.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_CE_CONVERSATION_AI_GENERIC_TEXT_23">The AI says you should consider creating an AI avatar template based on your own persona. This way, other ship crews will be able to benefit from your skills. You tell the AI you will think about this.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_CE_CONVERSATION_AI_GENERIC_TEXT_24">Your AI asks if you will allow it to join an Engi hive after your mission is done. It thinks Engies are probably the only species which can truly understand AIs.</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_CE_CONVERSATION_AI_UPGRADES_1">"I have closely examined your life support system, Captain. I have rated its effectiveness and come to a devastating verdict."</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_CE_CONVERSATION_AI_UPGRADES_1_c1">Inquire on that verdict.</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_CE_CONVERSATION_AI_UPGRADES_1_c1_e">"Permission to speak freely, Captain?" You nod. Where is this going? "Honestly Captain, I'm surprised that you are still alive. Your life support is barely rocket age, an antiquity by our standards. A simple 50k rewrite of the filter algorithms can improve its efficiency by 30 percent. I already made the relevant alterations. Have a nice day, Captain." The hologram leaves you baffled.</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_CE_CONVERSATION_AI_UPGRADES_1_c2_e">"The system is inefficient and primitive. You should probably worry more about that than me Captain, as I don't require clean air to breathe, nor am I susceptible to heat, cold or radiation. You might want to invest some material into upgrading this system." You sarcastically thank the AI for its service. "A pleasure, my Captain."</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_CE_CONVERSATION_AI_UPGRADES_1_c3">Inform the AI that you are not interested in computer generated smugness.</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_CE_CONVERSATION_AI_UPGRADES_1_c3_e">"But... sorry, Captain." You leave the Avatar standing in the corridor and return to the bridge.</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_CE_CONVERSATION_AI_UPGRADES_2">"I have closely examined your ship's navigation computer, Captain. I have rated the helms effectiveness and come to a devastating verdict."</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_CE_CONVERSATION_AI_UPGRADES_2_c1_e">"Permission to speak freely, Captain?" You nod. Where is this going? "Honestly Captain, I'm surprised that we are still flying. The evasion algorithms look like from a simple computer game. I took the liberty to splice parts of my program to create a working autopilot for a start. I named it Sarah. Hope you like it, Captain." The hologram leaves you baffled.</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_CE_CONVERSATION_AI_UPGRADES_2_c2_e">"The system is primitive, but cannot be upgraded without investing some materials." You sarcastically thank the AI for its service. "A pleasure, my Captain."</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_CE_CONVERSATION_AI_UPGRADES_3">"I have closely examined your sensor system, Captain. I have rated its effectiveness and come to a devastating verdict."</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_CE_CONVERSATION_AI_UPGRADES_3_c1_e">"Permission to speak freely, Captain?" You nod. Where is this going? "Honestly Captain, I'm surprised you can even detect me standing here. You've never heard about passive subspace waves? Even your antique antenna can pick that up. I already reconfigured the buffers and sensor performance should have improved significantly. Have a nice day, Captain." The hologram leaves you baffled.</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_CE_CONVERSATION_AI_UPGRADES_4">"I have closely examined your ship reactor, Captain. I have rated its effectiveness and come to a devastating verdict."</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_CE_CONVERSATION_AI_UPGRADES_4_c1_e">"Permission to speak freely, Captain?" You nod. Where is this going? "Honestly Captain, I'm surprised this reactor generates any power at all. Fusion mixture is only adjusted every millisecond? I drew up an algorithm that monitors matter composition in subspace realtime. Generator performance should have improved already. Have a nice day, Captain." The hologram leaves you baffled.</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_CE_CONVERSATION_LANIUS_GENERIC_16">You catch the Lanius while it is absorbing some random scrap item. This could still have been of use, but you decide to let it slide this time. The Lanius normally just eats modified Federation rations, enriched with minerals, and these seem to disgust the being quite a bit.</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_CE_CONVERSATION_LANIUS_GENERIC_17">You ask the Lanius how it feels today. It proudly announces: "I am... ready to do sex, Captain." A few other crewmen nearby can't suppress a laughter. "I'm not joking, Captain. Give me metal and... I shall multiply!"</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_CE_CONVERSATION_LANIUS_GENERIC_17_c1">"Alright, take some metal."</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_CE_CONVERSATION_LANIUS_GENERIC_17_c2">"Thank you, but that won't be necessary."</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_CE_CONVERSATION_LANIUS_GENERIC_17_c2_e">The Lanius nods overly enthusiastically. "I... understand... Captain." It leaves without another word.</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_CE_CONVERSATION_LANIUS_HOSTILE_23">As far as you can tell, the Lanius seems troubled. "This plain... hazard..." The Lanius gestures towards the ship doors. "Failure... there... Reshape... I?"</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_CE_CONVERSATION_LANIUS_HOSTILE_23_c1">"Eh, alright? Go ahead then."</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_CE_CONVERSATION_LANIUS_HOSTILE_24">As far as you can tell, the Lanius seems troubled. "This plain... hazard..." The Lanius gestures towards a nearby port window. "Should I... exit? I can fix the... skin?"</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_CE_CONVERSATION_LANIUS_HOSTILE_24_c1">"Sounds good. Go ahead."</text>
<text name="ce_textList_CE_CONVERSATION_LANIUS_GENERIC_TEXT_1">Your Lanius crew member has a lot to say, but you forgot your universal translator on the bridge. Its speech sometimes includes seemingly random nouns in your language, but you cannot gather what the crewman wants to say.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_CE_CONVERSATION_LANIUS_GENERIC_TEXT_2">The Lanius is nowhere to be found. The computer informs you that the crewman is in its personal quarters, absorbing its daily mineral ration.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_CE_CONVERSATION_LANIUS_GENERIC_TEXT_3">The Lanius is nowhere to be found. The computer informs you that the crewman has gone into a quick stasis nap in its personal quarters.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_CE_CONVERSATION_LANIUS_GENERIC_TEXT_4">The Lanius is nowhere to be found. The computer informs you that it is currently taking a walk outside, on the hull of the ship. You wonder if there is an article in Federation protocol that regulates this.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_CE_CONVERSATION_LANIUS_GENERIC_TEXT_5">The Lanius is nowhere to be found. The computer informs you that it is on a space walk, checking the Hull for micro breaches. The anaerobic being seems to enjoy being outside in space quite a bit.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_CE_CONVERSATION_LANIUS_GENERIC_TEXT_6">The Lanius is nowhere to be found. You hope it's not eating some part of the ship right now.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_CE_CONVERSATION_LANIUS_GENERIC_TEXT_7">The Lanius is not very talkative. It just repeatedly mumbles a single word: "Hunger..."</text>
<text name="ce_textList_CE_CONVERSATION_LANIUS_GENERIC_TEXT_8">The Lanius is not very talkative. It just repeatedly mumbles a single word: "Eat..."</text>
<text name="ce_textList_CE_CONVERSATION_LANIUS_GENERIC_TEXT_9">The Lanius is not very talkative. It just repeatedly mumbles a single word: "Metal..."</text>
<text name="ce_textList_CE_CONVERSATION_LANIUS_GENERIC_TEXT_11">The Lanius tries to explain something, but the meaning is lost in translation. Both of you still have to learn a lot about each other's language.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_CE_CONVERSATION_LANIUS_GENERIC_TEXT_13">You find the Lanius polishing its arm blades in the main hold. You decide better not to disturb the being.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_CE_CONVERSATION_LANIUS_GENERIC_TEXT_14">The Lanius states that, for a long time, it has killed and pillaged to survive. It wants to know how you evaluate this.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_CE_CONVERSATION_LANIUS_GENERIC_TEXT_16">You want to talk to the Lanius, but realize that your micro rebreather is completely depleted from the last conversation. Better not risk asphyxia just for a little chat. This will have to wait.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_CE_CONVERSATION_LANIUS_GENERIC_TEXT_17">You Lanius explains that its kind has developed special oxygen suits. It prevent the Lanius body from absorbing too much O2 in closed environments. The suits are mostly used by diplomats and traders. Unfortunately, your crewman did not bring one aboard.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_CE_CONVERSATION_LANIUS_GENERIC_TEXT_18">The Lanius confesses that it finds your eating habits extremely strange. "For me... these substances are dirt."</text>
<text name="ce_textList_CE_CONVERSATION_LANIUS_GENERIC_TEXT_19">The Lanius found out that its quite real "heart of steel" is a strong metaphor in your language. The anaerobic being finds this quite fascinating. "Even as a metaphor... this might be the truth for the great number... of my metallic... friends."</text>
<text name="ce_textList_CE_CONVERSATION_LANIUS_GENERIC_TEXT_20">You try to have a proper conversion with the Lanius but soon start to feel dizzy... what is happening? You cant breathe... Shortly before passing out, you wave the Lanius away from you and head for the bulkhead. Their oxygen absorbing metabolism should not be underestimated. The crewman later sends a crudely translated apology.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_CE_CONVERSATION_LANIUS_GENERIC_TEXT_21">You picked up a few words of Lanic during your travel and use your little language skills to ask the crewman how it feels today. It reacts with a gesture that, according to your pan-alien transcultural training, might indicate insult. Did you say something wrong?</text>
<text name="ce_textList_CE_CONVERSATION_LANIUS_GENERIC_TEXT_22">The Lanius confesses that it finds your kind most unusual. "You are similar to... fictional characters from our... great text assortments. Almost like... not from this Galaxy? Scientific impossibilities!"</text>
<text name="ce_textList_CE_CONVERSATION_LANIUS_GENERIC_TEXT_24">The Lanius tries to explain that its species does not deserve the bad reputation it got. "Forceful acquisition is wrong... even by the standards of my living species. But my people are... hungry."</text>
<text name="ce_textList_CE_CONVERSATION_LANIUS_GENERIC_TEXT_25">The Lanius mourns that its species' demanding metabolism has caused the galaxy so much suffering. "We are no... villains Captain. We just... need to feed us."</text>
<text name="ce_textList_CE_CONVERSATION_LANIUS_GENERIC_TEXT_26">The Lanius asks how much data you have about this sector. "Are there... metallic opportunities?"</text>
<text name="ce_textList_CE_CONVERSATION_LANIUS_GENERIC_TEXT_27">You find the Lanius in the mess hall. While you eat your ration, a sluggish conversation ensues. After you finish eating, the Lanius points both its bladed arms at your synth-steel plate. "You... still eat him?" You slowly shake your head. The Lanius grabs the plate and absorbs it into its hand. "The best ration... on this plain, Captain. You should... train in it?"</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_CE_CONVERSATION_LANIUS_RESHAPE_DOORS_1">The Lanius shakes its head dramatically. "No Captain... understand! Reshape... means damage. Agreeable?"</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_CE_CONVERSATION_LANIUS_RESHAPE_DOORS_1_c1">"Yes, go ahead."</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_CE_CONVERSATION_LANIUS_RESHAPE_DOORS_1_c1_e">The Lanius nods overly enthusiastically. "I... understand... Captain." The Lanius heads off. You wonder if you really understood what this is about. A few minutes later, an internal damage warning pops up on your terminal. The Lanius has started to absorb parts of your ship.</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_CE_CONVERSATION_LANIUS_RESHAPE_DOORS_1_c1_e_c1_e">The rest of the crew informs you that the Lanius has started to fuse metal from the internal hull plating into various bulkhead doors. You order them to let the alien proceed with what it is doing. Looks like it is manually upgrading your doors using its inherent abilities. You hope the structural integrity of the vessel will not suffer too much.</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_CE_CONVERSATION_LANIUS_RESHAPE_DOORS_1_c2">"Damage? No!"</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_CE_CONVERSATION_LANIUS_RESHAPE_HULL_1">"I call this a... great decision, Captain... Will you give me minerals for the... Quest?"</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_CE_CONVERSATION_LANIUS_RESHAPE_HULL_1_c1">"Take anything you need."</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_CE_CONVERSATION_LANIUS_RESHAPE_HULL_1_c1_e">The Lanius grabs a seemingly random bunch of equipment and heads for the airlock. Its feet seem to fuse with the plating at each step it takes on the ship hull, preventing it from floating off. You realize that the supplies in its arms are already gone, and that hull ruptures have disappeared wherever it stepped. The Lanius' metal-shaping ability is indeed extraordinary.</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_CE_CONVERSATION_LANIUS_RESHAPE_HULL_1_c2">"This will be problematic... we can't spare anything."</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_CE_CONVERSATION_LANIUS_MULTIPLY_1">The Lanius piles up some of the scrap from your holds. You wonder if you should actually be watching. The Lanius lifts one of its bladed arms, and extends the other in front of it. With a single swipe, and no mimic reaction, the crewman cuts its own arm off, letting it fall into the scrap pile. "Reproduction complete, Captain. This was most private, but I understand that... you cannot have manners."</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_CE_CONVERSATION_LANIUS_MULTIPLY_1_c1_e">Your crewman's arm is already reforming while the cut of limb merges with the metal and turns it gray. After some time, the metal pile has formed into a Lanius body. The creature awakes and greets its new environment with gargling noises, but its creator seems to understand. You order the new crewman to be taught a few words of Federation standard as fast as possible.</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_CE_CONVERSATION_CRYSTAL_GENERIC_23">"Ah Captain, I was thinking... there is something I'd like to show you."</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_CE_CONVERSATION_CRYSTAL_GENERIC_23_c1">"All right. What is it?"</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_CE_CONVERSATION_CRYSTAL_GENERIC_24">The Crystal ask to talk to you in private. As you nod, it locks the room's doors with growing crystals and explains, "I've done it Captain!" The Crystal points at its creation.</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_CE_CONVERSATION_CRYSTAL_GUNS_1">"I experimented a little with Federation drone technology and integrated some crystal principles. Do you want to test the result?"</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_CE_CONVERSATION_CRYSTAL_GUNS_6">"I reproduced one of our weapons aboard your ship. You can use it, if you agree not to share this technology with the Federation."</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_CE_CONVERSATION_CRYSTAL_GUNS_10">The crewman has seeded a growing crystal in its personal quarters. The unknown material has formed into what remotely looks like a ship weapon. "It is experimental, but it might be put to use for our ongoing struggle."</text>
<text name="ce_textList_CE_CONVERSATION_CRYSTAL_GENERIC_TEXT_1">The Crystal does not know what to say to you. The being seems lost in the conversation.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_CE_CONVERSATION_CRYSTAL_GENERIC_TEXT_4">Your Crystal crew member says it is somewhat surprised to see how religious Rockman are. It wonders if some Rockman might consider worshiping it.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_CE_CONVERSATION_CRYSTAL_GENERIC_TEXT_5">The Crystal asks if you would like to have it produce a crystal object as a present. "I can grow any shape you want, Captain." You are a little overwhelmed by the possibilities and ask for time to think about it.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_CE_CONVERSATION_CRYSTAL_GENERIC_TEXT_6">The Crystal gives you a friendly greeting. It holds out its hand and lets a clear crystaline cup sprout from its hand. "I made this for you, my Captain. Please accept it."</text>
<text name="ce_textList_CE_CONVERSATION_CRYSTAL_GENERIC_TEXT_7">The Crystal asks if you have heard about the Lanius. "These beings seem to have lived almost as secluded as my kind. They also are not as dependant on oxygen as much. I wonder how it would be to meet them?"</text>
<text name="ce_textList_CE_CONVERSATION_CRYSTAL_GENERIC_TEXT_8">The Crystal says it is happy to have met the people of the Federation. "This is all very fascinating, Captain."</text>
<text name="ce_textList_CE_CONVERSATION_CRYSTAL_GENERIC_TEXT_10">The Crystal gives a detailed account on what it has learned about the current conflict. "With all due respect, your species seems to have little regard for self preservation. I'm glad that your kind survived so long."</text>
<text name="ce_textList_CE_CONVERSATION_CRYSTAL_GENERIC_TEXT_11">The Crystal asks permission to use growing crystals from its body to "redecorate" its personal quarters and make it more "cozy". You say it's ok as long as this does not affect the ship's performance.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_CE_CONVERSATION_CRYSTAL_GENERIC_TEXT_12">Your Crystal crew member tells about its ability to control crystalline growths. Apparently Crystal weapons are based on this ability in order to create shard projectiles.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_CE_CONVERSATION_CRYSTAL_GENERIC_TEXT_13">The Crystal asks you why the other species spread so much throughout the sectors. Its opinion on the matter, "No wonder you are all at war - you're too crowded."</text>
<text name="ce_textList_CE_CONVERSATION_CRYSTAL_GENERIC_TEXT_14">The Crystal is surprised with the efficiency of the life support system on your ship. It tells you the lowered metabolism of Crystals made them less dependent on such systems on their ships.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_CE_CONVERSATION_CRYSTAL_GENERIC_TEXT_15">The Crystal asks you to try and visit some more Rockman sectors. It hopes to study their social habits and understand why they have become so aggressive.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_CE_CONVERSATION_CRYSTAL_GENERIC_TEXT_16">Your Crystal crew member says it has a small surprise for you. It hands you a small crystalline model of your ship, and says it is a token of its appreciation for your abilities as Captain.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_CE_CONVERSATION_CRYSTAL_GENERIC_TEXT_17">Your Crystal is interested in the weapon technologies common in the Federation. It thinks Crystal weaponry can be improved based on this information.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_CE_CONVERSATION_CRYSTAL_GENERIC_TEXT_18">Your Crystal is impressed with the ferociousness of the Mantis. It tells you they will probably be the biggest threat to all the other species in the sectors.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_CE_CONVERSATION_CRYSTAL_GENERIC_TEXT_19">The Crystal crew member is apprehensive about Slugs. "They are so greedy and we know nothing of your galaxy." It assumes the Slugs will try to take advantage of its kind.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_CE_CONVERSATION_CRYSTAL_GENERIC_TEXT_20">The Crystal looks a little light headed when you speak. It tells you it is not used to the high oxygen pressure on your ship. You assume the Crystal will get used to it, but order a medical checkup nevertheless.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_CE_CONVERSATION_CRYSTAL_GENERIC_TEXT_21">The Crystal assumes that everything coming from outside its hidden home-world would have great value there. "My kind would surely buy all these silly and curious objects that the aliens trade at good prices."</text>
<text name="ce_textList_CE_CONVERSATION_CRYSTAL_GENERIC_TEXT_22">Upon inquiring, the crewman explains that the retaliation crystals of its factions ships are actually using resonance energy from kinetic impacts to target and propel themselves. You consider that it just made this up.</text>
<text name="ce_event_FLEET_EASY">The Rebel fleet has already taken this beacon!</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_C_FLEET_LIST_1">It seems the Rebels won't take any more chances with you, they send in an automated spotter unit to mark your ship for a long-range artillery strike. The fleet will unleash its full combined firepower on you if you don't manage to jump away in time.</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_C_FLEET_LIST_6">A nearby scout turns to engage. You must flee before their cruisers open fire!</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_C_FLEET_LIST_7">You are lucky, the capital ships are still too far away and a scout is sent to deal with you. You must flee before their cruisers open fire!</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_C_FLEET_LIST_8">You try to get as far away from the beacon as its jump radius allows, but the Rebels send a small scout after you. You must flee before their cruisers get in firing range!</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_C_FLEET_LIST_9">A small fighter craft is the only ship in weapon range for now. You must flee before their cruisers open fire!</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_C_FLEET_LIST_10">A nearby escort unit turns to engage. You must flee before their cruisers open fire!</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_C_FLEET_LIST_11">An escort gunboat moves in to intercept. You must flee before their cruisers open fire!</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_C_FLEET_LIST_12_c1_e">Fleeing seems to be a suitable option here... still, taking out an elite cruiser would surely throw the Rebel fleet into disarray.</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_C_FLEET_LIST_13_c1_e">Fleeing seems to be a suitable option here... still, taking out an enemy cruiser would surely throw the Rebel fleet into disarray.</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_C_FLEET_LIST_14_c1_e">Your cruiser is not designed to take on a battleship, if you want to get out of this alive you should probably jump away as fast as possible.</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_C_FLEET_LIST_15">You find yourself facing an entire Rebel engineering squadron here. Huge automated cruisers deliver materials to a slowly moving hangar ship. Com chatter gets frantic as soon as you arrive: "Oh flak! Red alert, we have been compromised. All defense assets, converge on the position of the rogue Federation vessel!"</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_C_FLEET_LIST_15_c1_e">A Rebel admiral cuts in and establishes a video feed: "Disregard this order. Hold back, we will deal with this personally." She turns to you: "This is the last thing I expected to happen. You after all, should know what we are building here, right? Lets put it to the test then" The admiral's ship emerges from the mobile hangar. Although it is unfinished, it matches the specs of the Rebel Flagship!</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_C_FLEET_LIST_DLC_6">A nearby scout turns to engage. The cruisers in the distance are firing on you with their mid-range main guns!</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_C_FLEET_LIST_DLC_6_c2_e">The Rebels are not the only ones that can call in fire support. You dispatch your own ASB and turn the fight into a full blown artillery skirmish.</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_C_FLEET_LIST_DLC_7">The capital ships are closing in fast and open fire with their main guns. You try to break through their lines, but there are smaller scouts everywhere. You have to jump out of here!</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_C_FLEET_LIST_DLC_8">You try to get as far away from the beacon as its jump radius allows, but the Rebels send a small scout after you. Soon after some of the cruisers short jump closer to you and open fire!</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_C_FLEET_LIST_DLC_9">A small Rebel fighter craft is the closes ship, but their cruisers open fire with their mid-range main cannons!</text>

<text name="ce_textList_C_FLEET_NOTHING_TEXT_1">The bulk of the fleet has already moved passed this location. You slowly navigate the ship below the beacon and power down all non-essential systems. A seemingly endless caravan of Rebel supply ships moves past, huge lifter crafts accompanied by smaller pushers, but no one notices you. When the FTL is charged, you prepare for a low profile fast jump.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_C_FLEET_NOTHING_TEXT_2">The beacon is flagged as "liberated", but suprisingly there are no ships around. The fleet must have moved on already. You can't believe your luck.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_C_FLEET_NOTHING_TEXT_3">You spot a few cruisers in the distance, but they move away quickly and do not seem to notice you. It is clear that you won't be always this lucky. You have to get out of Rebel territory immediately.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_C_FLEET_NOTHING_TEXT_4">This beacon is under Rebel control, but the fleet has not reinforced this position and did not even leave a guard unit. A mistake you can now exploit.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_C_FLEET_NOTHING_TEXT_5">The Rebels have already move past the beacon and suddenly you find yourself behind enemy lines. You try to lay low and it is only luck that there are so few ships in the vicinity. A few auto scouts zip past, but do not actively scan and just seem to be dedicated to reach the front line as fast as possible.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_C_FLEET_NOTHING_TEXT_6">To your surprise, no hostile ships are in the area. The front line must have moved already. Large caravans of civilian ships slowly follow in the wake of the fleet. Are these sympathizers? Traders? The rebels families? You have to lay low, so you can't find out.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_C_FLEET_NOTHING_TEXT_7">The Rebel guard units have been stationed far in the distance to deter any threads to a large civilian caravan. The people here naturally assume that you are a deserter or Rebel mercenary and engage in friendly chatting. They hope to found a new colony somewhere in conquered Rebel space, since their home planet has been devastated in the current conflict.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_C_FLEET_BATTLESHIP_TEXT_1">A bright flash of white light fills the vidscreen as a Rebel battleship jumps in. "This is the Rebel officer Offensive Unit RS 'Burst Damage' ..." The highly decorated Rebel on your screen dismissively stares at you for a few seconds and then simply cuts communication. The computer warns of multiple weapon locks.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_C_FLEET_BATTLESHIP_TEXT_2">As you jump in you first think the Rebels have towed a space station here. Then you realize that the massive structure in front of you is what the computer defines as a threat level 18 Rebel Medium Offense Unit. "This is the RS 'Inspiral, Coalescence, Ringdown'.

<text name="ce_textList_C_FLEET_BATTLESHIP_TEXT_3">The fleet has already passed the beacon. Suddenly you find yourself behind enemy lines. You hope that they don't notice you, but then a rear guard battleship jumps in, causing a shock-wave in space-time that can be detected in the entire system.

<text name="ce_textList_C_FLEET_BATTLESHIP_TEXT_4">You jumped in right in front of a Rebel capital ship. The computer almost can't put enough warning messages on the vidscreen.

<text name="ce_textList_C_FLEET_BATTLESHIP_TEXT_5">As you jump in, all the Rebel ships in the system immediately change course and converge on your position.

<text name="ce_textList_C_FLEET_BATTLESHIP_TEXT_6">It seems like your luck has run out. The Rebels moved in a battleship to cover this beacon.

<text name="ce_textList_C_FLEET_BATTLESHIP_TEXT_18">It seems like your luck has run out. The Rebels moved in a battleship to cover this beacon. Its weapons are primed, its thick hull is polished and its crew made of hard-boiled space marine badasses is hungry for blood. They hail your ship, "This is the RS 'Lasting Damage'. We will ruin your day!"</text>
<text name="ce_event_FLEET_EASY_BEACON">You've found the long-range relay but the Rebels got here first! You must survive long enough to be able to jump to the next sector.</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_CE_FLEET_BEACON_LIST_1">The Rebel ships have taken defensive position away from the beacon. You know what this means. An automated spotter unit zips past on the vidscreen. It acquires your ship and transmits your exact position to the Rebel fleet. Soon their point defense artillery will be unleashed against you.</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_CE_FLEET_BEACON_LIST_DLC_1">The Rebel fleet closes in fast and the cruisers start firing on you with their main guns. You try to quickly slip through their lines, but a fighter craft intercepts you.</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_CE_FLEET_SALVAGE_1">You manage to get away with a few materials before the cruisers get their first barrage off. That was close! Maybe too close? It is definitely time to leave.</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_CE_FLEET_SALVAGE_2">You prepare to quickly take some of the salvage aboard, but it is not long before a stray ASB shot pierces through your ship. Others hit the wreckage and the salvage operation becomes unmanageable. You have to get out of here!</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_CE_FLEET_SALVAGE_3">You reconfigure the collector magnets and quickly grab a few parts in fly-by. The fleet moves in closer in the meantime. "ASB barrage incoming!" The ship shudders under multiple impacts and you are thrown out of your seat. "Hull breaches on the main deck, Captain!" Was this worth it?</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_CE_FLEET_SALVAGE_4">Several cruisers fire their ASB and a full volley crushes into your ship before you can even get close to the wreckage. Your crew scrambles to examine the damage. "We can't stay here captain, you'll get us all killed!"</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_CE_FLEET_SALVAGE_CREW_DEAD_2">You prepare to quickly take some of the salvage aboard, but it is not long before a stray ASB shot pierces through your ship.

<text name="ce_eventList_CE_FLEET_SALVAGE_CREW_DEAD_4">Just after you give the salvage order, several Rebel cruisers fire their ASB and a full volley crushes into your ship. The salvage team screams through the comms: "We can't stay here captain, you'll get us all killed!"</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_CE_FLEET_SALVAGE_CLOAK_1">You make your ship disappear once more. The Rebels obviously believe that you'll try to jump. They hurry towards the next beacon. This allows you to collect a small amount of salvage.</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_CE_FLEET_SALVAGE_CLOAK_2">You slip back into cloak and proceed to salvage some of the scrap left behind by the battle. A few Rebel cruisers stay behind and the absence of a jump signature tells them that you are still around. They start to fire full spread ASB shots in all directions! It is not long before your craft is hit by a stray projectile. You are forced to aboard the salvage operation.</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_CE_FLEET_SALVAGE_CLOAK_3">The Rebels anticipate your intentions. A few ASB shots impact on the wreck of the Rebel craft and blow it to small bits. Nothing remains salvageable. Then the cruisers start to fire a full spread patter. They will hit you eventually, you have to get out of here!</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_DEAD_CREW_PIRACY_CIVILIAN_1">There are no more life signs remaining on the civilian vessel. You murdered these poor people and this constitutes an act of piracy. Your crew might be disturbed.</text>

<text name="ce_eventList_DEAD_CREW_PIRACY_CIVILIAN_RESULTS_3_clone">It probably would not be wise to revive such a rebellious person. One of your other crewmen watches silently from the doorway as you wipe the traitor's mind-backup.</text>

<text name="ce_event_CE_BOARDERS_BOUNTYHUNTER">Your jump leads you to nothing but empty space. This jump beacon serves no purpose other than as a connection. Suddenly, the computer reports a weak incoming teleporter signal. The internal sensors show nothing out of the ordinary though.</text>
<text name="ce_event_CE_BOARDERS_BOUNTYHUNTER_c1">Might be a malfunction. Run an internal scan.</text>

Of course I know who you are, I just hoped you wouldn't realize that I am with the union too. No hard feelings OK? I want the creed to be honored as much as anyone, where would we be if we would start backstabbing each other, hm? Good hunting."</text>
<text name="ce_event_CE_BOARDERS_BOUNTYHUNTER_c7_e_c1_e">The fellow bounty hunter teleports away without another word. When dedicated scans reveal his ship he is already prepared to jump. It looks like your connections to the bounty hunter syndicate just saved you from having to deal with a dangerous foe. The bounty on your head must be substantial if your colleagues are attempting things like this.</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_CE_BOARDERS_BOUNTYHUNTER_SCAN_1">The scan yields no results. Nothing came on board. The crew relaxes and you pour yourself some replicator-coffee while you wait for the FTL to charge. An announcement is made via the ship's speaker system, "Greetings, Captain.

<text name="ce_event_CE_DISTRESS_SUN">You discover that the distress signal originates from the center of a nearby system. A civilian vessel passed too close by the local sun. Their engines and shields were damaged by a solar flare and now they are in danger of drifting into the star.</text>

<text name="ce_eventList_CE_DISTRESS_SUN_DOCK_1">Another massive solar flare blasts into your ship right as you are about to complete the docking maneuver. The civilian vessel is torn away from your ship and their airlock gets ripped open in the process. You realize that there is no way to save them now.</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_CE_DISTRESS_SUN_DOCK_1_c1_e">"Nice try, Captain. We appreciate it. My crew and I come from a nearby colony. Please tell our loved ones what happened here.

<text name="ce_eventList_CE_DISTRESS_SUN_DOCK_2">Another massive solar flare blasts into your ships right as you are about to complete the docking maneuver. The civilian vessel is torn away from your ship and their airlock gets ripped open in the process. As bodies begin to spill out you realize that there is no way to save them now.</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_CE_DISTRESS_SUN_DOCK_3">Right as you are about to dock, another flare blasts into the civilian craft. The dampeners barely manage to compensate the impact. Most of the ship's crew suffered terminal radiation burns, but the ones you managed to save are grateful. You'll drop them off at the next station.</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_CE_DISTRESS_SUN_TELEPORT_1">They reluctantly agree. Your advanced teleporters manage to lock on, even from this range. Once aboard, you watch as their ship slowly drifts into the sun. They thank you, but say "I don't know what we'll do without our ship. As the Captain, I feel obligated to help you with your mission."</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_CE_DISTRESS_SUN_TELEPORT_2">They refuse at first, but after another flare ignites fires in their medbay they agree and beam aboard your ship. Your advanced teleporters manage to lock on, even from this range. They say, "Thank you but we really should return to our families... I'm sure we can muster up a reward if you take us home."</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_CE_DISTRESS_SUN_TELEPORT_2_c1">Take them to the nearby planet where they're from.</text>

<text name="ce_eventList_CE_DISTRESS_SUN_FAMILY_RETURN_3">Grim news has to be delivered here. After hearing what happened to their relatives, the families of the lost ship's crewmen are all deeply struck with grief. They politely thank you for informing them and insist on paying for your expenses. You are invited to join the symbolic funeral and stay for a short while.</text>
<text name="ce_event_CE_DISTRESS_DEFENSE">The distress beacon is coming from a small civilian station. They have been raided repeatedly by ships coming from a nearby pirate stronghold and actually hoped for the Rebels to come and save them. "Well, maybe the Federation is still good for something. Will you help us?"</text>
<text name="ce_event_CE_DISTRESS_DEFENSE_c1">Offer to lead the charge against the pirate hideout that is located in a nearby asteroid belt.</text>
<text name="ce_event_CE_DISTRESS_DEFENSE_c1_e">After some discussion, the local defenders agree with your idea. "Alright, let's do this. We keep their ships away from you while you pound their outpost. Take the lead." Their small defense force made up of scouts gets in formation behind your ship and you head out towards the pirate base.</text>
<text name="ce_event_CE_DISTRESS_DEFENSE_c1_e_c1_e">You advance towards the pirate station, hidden within the asteroid rings of the system's sixth planet. Your wingmen chase the pirates into the field while you start targeting the station. Full battle readiness!</text>
<text name="ce_event_CE_DISTRESS_DEFENSE_c2">Offer to stay a while and help repel the next attack.</text>
<text name="ce_event_CE_DISTRESS_DEFENSE_c2_e">You spend some time aboard the station, planning defense strategies. The crew and you make some new friends as well. Then the alarms go off. Here they come again! You hurry back to the ship. The fighting has already started when your cruiser detaches from the station; you target the nearest pirate.</text>
<text name="ce_event_CE_DISTRESS_DEFENSE_c3">(Ammo Manufacturer) Offer to refill their ammunition supplies.</text>
<text name="ce_event_CE_DISTRESS_DEFENSE_c3_e">Your produce a few warheads with materials the civilians provide. They offer some additional scrap as thanks.</text>
<text name="ce_event_CE_DISTRESS_DEFENSE_c4">(Minelauncher) Mine the perimeter. [ Missiles: -3 ]</text>
<text name="ce_event_CE_DISTRESS_DEFENSE_c4_e">The pirates will be in for a nasty surprise if they return.</text>
<text name="ce_event_CE_DISTRESS_DEFENSE_c4_e_c1_e">You receive a generous reward, although the station's crew laments that such measures are necessary these days.</text>
<text name="ce_event_CE_DISTRESS_DEFENSE_c5">(Minelayer Drone) Leave one of your drones behind and have it mine the perimeter. [ Drones: -1 ]</text>
<text name="ce_event_CE_DISTRESS_DEFENSE_c6">Explain that this is none of your business.</text>
<text name="ce_event_CE_DISTRESS_DEFENSE_c6_e">"Thought so. Well, maybe the Rebels will be more helpful. For now we will manage on our own. Take care on your journey." You prepare to jump on.</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_DEFENSE_OFFENSE_LIST_1">Only three of the civilian defenders report in. "That didn't go so well... Some of our best friends died today, but I guess it had to be done..." They reluctantly thank you for your help and offer a small reward.</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_DEFENSE_OFFENSE_LIST_2">Only two of the defenders report in. "The outlaws knew their turf quite well. We suffered heavy damage from asteroid impacts... Seriously, you do this stuff on a daily basis? We've got to search for our friends... " They thank you for your help and offer a small reward, then head off into the field.</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_DEFENSE_OFFENSE_LIST_3">You hail repeatedly on all frequencies, but get no response. After some searching you discover one of the civilian ships drifting within the field, with no life signs detected. Post-battle analysis suggests that the whole defense force was wiped out. You decide to get out of here before the pirate ships come for you.</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_DEFENSE_SUCCESS_LIST_1">Although station and ships have taken some damage, the whole operation is considered a success. A young crewman is so amazed by your commitment that they offer to join your team.</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_DEFENSE_SUCCESS_LIST_1_c1_e">You dock and take your new crewman on board. Then you say goodbye to everyone and prepare to jump.</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_DEFENSE_SUCCESS_LIST_2">"We did it. I'm pretty sure these outlaws won't harass us again. Thanks for your help, Captain." They transmit some supplies and wish you farewell.</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_DEFENSE_SUCCESS_LIST_3">The attack was repelled, but the station took heavy damage. "Thanks for your help, Captain. We can't spare a lot right now, but you should take some of our supplies. We wouldn't have made it without you." They transmit some scrap and wish you farewell.</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_DEFENSE_SUCCESS_LIST_4">"Wow, we really showed them! Guess we won't need all of these guns no more. You should take one with you. Take care out there." They install a piece of equipment on your ship and you prepare to jump after saying goodbye to everyone.</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_DEFENSE_SUCCESS_LIST_5">"So, I guess we don't have to rely on the Rebel fleet after all. My crew can patch up some of your hull damage as thanks." You say goodbye to everyone and then prepare to travel onwards.</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_DEFENSE_SUCCESS_LIST_6">"Thanks for your help, Captain. I guess it was to no avail, though." The station took some heavy hits and its hull integrity starts to fail. The civilian ships hurry to help with the evacuation. "We will all be homeless soon..." There is nothing left to be done here.</text>
<text name="ce_event_CE_DISTRESS_MELTDOWN">Once you arrive at the location of the distress call, a small cargo ship hails you: "Shiny! Glad you are not another pirate. We were ambushed by some outlaws and our shield power couplers were damaged beyond repair. We have energy, but can't get our shields stabilized properly." If it comes to another fight, they will be totally defenseless this way.</text>
<text name="ce_event_CE_DISTRESS_MELTDOWN_c1">Offer to escort them to their home port.</text>
<text name="ce_event_CE_DISTRESS_MELTDOWN_c1_e">"You would do that? Some protection on the way home would be awesome! Okay, we will be right behind you." They transmit coordinates.</text>
<text name="ce_event_CE_DISTRESS_MELTDOWN_c2">Ignore their problem and move on.</text>
<text name="ce_event_CE_DISTRESS_MELTDOWN_c2_e">Your mission is too important. You can't waste time with this.</text>
<text name="ce_event_CE_DISTRESS_MELTDOWN_c3">This is almost too easy. Seize their cargo!</text>
<text name="ce_event_CE_DISTRESS_MELTDOWN_c4">(Zoltan Crew) Have your Zoltan energize their shields.</text>
<text name="ce_event_CE_DISTRESS_MELTDOWN_c4_e">You dock with the ship and your Zoltan calmly walks to the shield room. The being does not touch anything; it just concentrates for a few seconds and suddenly lights flicker, power levels increase, and the ship's shield bubbles come up strong.</text>
<text name="ce_event_CE_DISTRESS_MELTDOWN_c5">(Advanced Shields) Jump-start their shields with your generator.</text>
<text name="ce_event_CE_DISTRESS_MELTDOWN_c5_e">Your crew figures out a makeshift cable solution to connect your shield generator to theirs. The cargo crew is skeptical at first, but the power transfer actually works. You manage to start up their generator and it produces a stable shield ellipse.</text>
<text name="ce_event_CE_DISTRESS_MELTDOWN_c6">(Shield Charge Booster) Jump-start their shields with your charge booster.</text>
<text name="ce_event_CE_DISTRESS_MELTDOWN_c6_e">You dock with the ship, connect the booster to their shield generator and hit the charge button. Sparks fly from your console. "Wow, easy with the charge, fire in the shield room, but we got it under control and our shields came up!"</text>
<text name="ce_event_CE_DISTRESS_MELTDOWN_c7">(Shield Components) Give them spare parts.</text>
<text name="ce_event_CE_DISTRESS_MELTDOWN_c7_e">No one will miss one shield coupling when you sell the batch. You tell them that you have the necessary spare parts and they gladly accept it. After installing the coupling their shields come back up.</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_TE_REWARD_GOODS_CHEAP_1">The crew of the cargo ship is amazed and quite grateful. "Not sure we would have had a chance to get home alive without you. We are low on scrap, but we can give you some of our goods as compensation. They sell really good in far-off sectors, like nebulae and pirate territories."</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_TE_REWARD_GOODS_CHEAP_2">"Wow, that worked really well. Guess we have a chance to get home in one piece now. You should take some of our cargo. We just want to get out of this sector as quickly as possible. These consumer goods sell really well in far-off sectors, like nebulae and pirate territories. Try to make them worthwhile."</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_TE_REWARD_GOODS_CHEAP_3">The cargo ships crew is grateful. They transfer a part of their cargo, some industrial machines in pristine condition. The Captain hints this stuff could strike a great price in Mantis and Rock territory.</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_TE_REWARD_GOODS_CHEAP_4">The crew of the cargo ship seems a little embarrassed. "Sorry, but we don't have any scrap to spare. All we can give you is rocks and dirt. Ore sells great in Rebel territory. Maybe you can make a good deal there."</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_TE_REWARD_GOODS_CHEAP_5">The crew of the cargo ship seems a little embarrassed. "Sorry, but we don't have any scrap to spare. All we can give you is a part of our cargo. This stuff does not sell particular well anywhere, but it's still worth quite a bit."</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_TE_REWARD_GOODS_CHEAP_11">The crew of the cargo ship seems a little embarrassed. "Sorry, but we don't have any scrap to spare. All we can give you is a part of our cargo; precious diamonds, you will make a fortune!"</text>
<text name="ce_event_CE_DISTRESS_OXYGEN">You arrive at the distress beacon and find a civilian trader. Their ship is undamaged; they were simply careless and did not restock enough oxygen for their journey. It is unclear if they can make it to a settlement before they all suffocate.</text>
<text name="ce_event_CE_DISTRESS_OXYGEN_c1">Dock and flood their ship with oxygen.</text>
<text name="ce_event_CE_DISTRESS_OXYGEN_c2">(Improved Life Support) Refill their tanks.</text>
<text name="ce_event_CE_DISTRESS_OXYGEN_c2_e">Your advanced life support re-pressurizes their tanks with pure O2. The traders will be fine and can even complete their cargo run. Out of gratefulness, they offer a reward.</text>
<text name="ce_event_CE_DISTRESS_OXYGEN_c3">(Adaptive Gel Suits) You can spare one or two of your environmental suits.</text>
<text name="ce_event_CE_DISTRESS_OXYGEN_c3_e">"Thanks. These might save us in case we run out completely." They agree to pay a decent price for the devices.</text>
<text name="ce_event_CE_DISTRESS_OXYGEN_c4">(Compressed Nebula Gas) Give them a few canisters from your gas shipment.</text>
<text name="ce_event_CE_DISTRESS_OXYGEN_c4_e">You can't help but grin a little when you hand over a few small tanks of freshly mined O2 to the visibly embarrassed trader crew. They offer some scrap as payment.</text>
<text name="ce_event_CE_DISTRESS_OXYGEN_c5">Nothing we can do for them.</text>
<text name="ce_event_CE_DISTRESS_OXYGEN_c5_e">They brought this upon themselves. Let's hope they make it and learn a lesson.</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_CE_DISTRESS_OXYGEN_BORING_1">The crew of the cargo ship is glad to breathe some clean air. "Thank you, Captain. I can't believe we got ourselves into this. Let's hope we make it to a settlement quick." They offer a small compensation.</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_CE_DISTRESS_OXYGEN_BORING_2">The crew of the cargo ship is glad to breathe some clean air. "Thank you, Captain; but this might not be enough. We will jump on now. Let's hope we can repay you one day." They detach from your ship.</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_CE_DISTRESS_OXYGEN_BORING_3">The airlocks open and few individuals pour into your hold, gasping for air. Their life-support situation seems to be worse than you expected. Your ear terminal beeps: "Captain, we detect small arms in the hold. These chumps are armed." You security officer raises a blaster. The situation escalates surprisingly quick. However, their small ship will make for some salvage.</text>
<text name="ce_event_CE_DISTRESS_DRONES">The distress signal is coming from a heavily guarded mining platform. An unhappy employee has sabotaged the drone control.

<text name="ce_eventList_CE_DISTRESS_DRONES_BORING_2">You spend a lot of time and energy firing on drones from all angles. They are designed to be difficult to hit, so it's no wonder that you don't succeed. You give up quite annoyed.</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_CE_DISTRESS_DRONES_BORING_3">You start firing full barges against the drones that zip around the station. A few shots hit the station's shields, which allows the drones to cut away a few antennas. You are hailed, "We appreciate the effort, but we think this is enough." You notice that their defense satellites came online. Time to leave?</text>

The Pirate ship hails, "The wanted note says dead or alive, Captain. Just send us the camera feed of the murdering when you are done." They seem quite amused by the course of events.</text>
<text name="ce_event_CE_LONE_SHUTTLE">After arriving at the beacon you detect a small, one-man shuttle craft that is headed straight for you. Repeated hails yield no response. You've got a strange feeling about this.</text>

<text name="ce_event_CE_LONE_SHUTTLE_c1_e">The shuttle has no defenses and breaks apart under your heavy weapon fire.</text>

<text name="ce_eventList_LONE_SHUTTLE_WAIT_5_c1_e_c1_e">Scans show no biological remains in the vessel; it was unmanned... very strange. Whatever it wanted to teleport, it probably wasn't a good thing.</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_LONE_SHUTTLE_WAIT_5_c2_e">The shuttle transported multiple explosive devices to the your ship before self-destructing. The ship is only lightly damaged, but one crewmember is caught in one of the explosions and dies from their injuries.</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_LONE_SHUTTLE_WAIT_5_c2_e_clone">The exploded crewmate's clone is soon ready. You jettison their previous, badly disfigured, remains.</text>

<text name="ce_eventList_LONE_SHUTTLE_DESTROY_4">Scans show no biological remains in the vessel; it was unmanned... very strange.</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_LONE_SHUTTLE_DESTROY_5">In the wreckage, you detect multiple human remains, but you also discover an encrypted Rebel communications system. That's one less enemy ship to worry about.</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_LONE_SHUTTLE_DESTROY_6">A Rebel ship arrives at the beacon. "Ah! It seems you did our dirty work for us. Nothing worse than Engi refugees. Let us give you some spare supplies as thanks, we've been chasing those Federation lapdogs through two sectors." Luckily they're too grateful for your help to notice who you are.</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_LONE_SHUTTLE_SLUG_1">"It is unmanned, Captain. I do not sense anyone, but this does not seem right. I advise caution." You decide to take the advice and move on.</text>

You give the order and the small craft is annihilated by a full salvo of your weapon array. The Rebels for sure didn't see that coming.</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_LONE_SHUTTLE_SCANNER_1">The scanners show the shuttle is unmanned, demilitarized and abandoned. You take what little fuel remains in its reactor core.</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_LONE_SHUTTLE_SCANNER_2">Scans reveal Rebel Marines on board the shuttle, as well as a hidden teleporter. Without wasting much of a thought you give the order to open fire. The small craft is blasted to pieces.</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_LONE_SHUTTLE_SCANNER_3">Scans reveal the shuttle is packed with explosives, equipped with short range teleporters and controlled by a rudimentary Rebel AI. It's a trap. Without wasting much of a thought you give the order to open fire and the small craft is blasted to pieces.</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_LONE_SHUTTLE_SCANNER_4">Scans show the shuttle is manned by single crewman and that its sensors are malfunctioning. You open a channel. "Are you with the Federation?

<text name="ce_eventList_CE_DERELICT_TREASURE_REWARD_2">When you get close enough to start scrapping the wreckage, your systems detect a transmission going out. It seems the Rebels rigged it with surveillance drones to spy on ships that pass by. You have to get away immediately.</text>

<text name="ce_textList_CIVILIAN_TRADE_DEPOT_TEXT_2">The space station is offering local goods. They do not offer ship equipment though.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_CIVILIAN_TRADE_DEPOT_TEXT_3">A trade depot orbits the nearby planet. Multiple merchant ships are docked. Looks like you can strike a bargain here. They seem to trade only in bulk goods and are not interested in buying.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_CIVILIAN_TRADE_DEPOT_TEXT_4">A space mall sells trade goods to ships coming and going from this settlement.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_CIVILIAN_TRADE_DEPOT_TEXT_5">You spot a civilian trade depot nearby. Passive scans indicate they are storing locally produced goods. They notice your interest and offer a sale. They don't sell ship equipment though...</text>
<text name="ce_textList_CIVILIAN_TRADE_DEPOT_TEXT_6">An unprotected trade depot lingers nearby. They reluctantly offer to sell some of their goods. The station's chief seems nervous because of all the firepower you brought here.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_CIVILIAN_TRADE_DEPOT_TEXT_7">A civilian trade depot hails, "Federation? Well we don't care, not many militia units or Rebels come around here. Just keep your big guns holstered, alright?" They offer to sell some goods.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_CIVILIAN_TRADE_DEPOT_TEXT_8">A trade depot is storing and trading goods here. They greet you, "OK... we detect a lot of weaponry on your ship. Do we have to call in the militia or do you just want to politely buy some stuff?" They seem to feel threatened.</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_CIVILIAN_TRADE_DEPOT_LIST_1">You consider making a deal here. This might take some time.</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_CIVILIAN_TRADE_DEPOT_LIST_1_c4">Change your mind and leave.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_CIVILIAN_TRADE_DEPOT_BUY_TEXT_1">You transfer the scrap. While your crew loads the cargo. Time passes.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_CIVILIAN_TRADE_DEPOT_BUY_TEXT_2">You write a scrap transfer order. Processing it takes a while, loading the cargo takes even longer.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_CIVILIAN_TRADE_DEPOT_BUY_TEXT_3">You hand over the crates with the scrap. Loading the cargo takes its time, the cargo drones are in much less of a hurry than you.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_CIVILIAN_TRADE_DEPOT_BUY_TEXT_4">To seal the deal you have to give detailed explanations on your trade license and your (fake) ship registration. Everything is double-checked. Why is this taking so long? Then the cargo is finally loaded, slowly.</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_CIVILIAN_TRADE_DEPOT_LIST_BOOSTED_1">You consider making a deal here. Your cargo teleporter will make trading easier.</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_CE_PIRACY_ATTACK_ROCK_1">Your crew indeed expected you might handle things like this. The mission is paramount after all. The Federation has to be re-established!</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_CE_PIRACY_ATTACK_MANTIS_1">None of your crew members is really surprised by your disrespect for Federation rules and individual lives. You engage the ship.</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_CE_PIRACY_ATTACK_SLUG_1">(Slug Ship) You command a vessel of the sly and treacherous Slugs. Your crew knew this mission wouldn't go that clean.</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_DESTROYED_PIRACY_CIVILIAN_STATION_1">The depot breaks apart, the civilians on board are sucked into space. One of the merchants is thrown towards your ship and ripped apart by the reaction of your shield ellipse. You just committed an act of piracy. This might disturb your crew.</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_DESTROYED_PIRACY_CIVILIAN_RESULTS_STATION_1">This was for the good of the mission, but you still can't help feeling like you lost your way. Crew morale is as low as it can get. Scans indicate some of stored cargo is still intact. You order a sweep.</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_DESTROYED_PIRACY_CIVILIAN_RESULTS_STATION_2">Your crew accuses you of betraying everything the Federation stands for. Some of the cargo seems to have survived the explosions. You run a tight beam scan.</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_DESTROYED_PIRACY_CIVILIAN_RESULTS_STATION_3">This was for the good of the mission, but still can't help feeling like you lost your way. Crew morale is as low as it can get. Scans indicate some of stored cargo is still intact. You order a sweep.</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_DESTROYED_PIRACY_CIVILIAN_RESULTS_STATION_9_clone">Your clonebay obviously won't revive your crewman, since they did not die.</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_DESTROYED_PIRACY_CIVILIAN_RESULTS_RISKLESS_STATION_1">The crew isn't questioning your course of action. Scans indicate some of the cargo is still intact. You order a sweep.</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_DESTROYED_PIRACY_CIVILIAN_RESULTS_RISKLESS_STATION_2">Your crew got used to your hard style of leadership. Some of the cargo seems to have survived the explosions. You run a tight beam scan.</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_DESTROYED_PIRACY_CIVILIAN_RESULTS_RISKLESS_STATION_4">The crew isn't questioning your course of action. They follow their orders and salvage what remains of the station.</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_DEAD_CREW_PIRACY_CIVILIAN_STATION_1">There are no more life signs remaining on the civilian station. You murdered these poor people and this constitutes an act of piracy. Your crew might be disturbed.</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_DEAD_CREW_PIRACY_CIVILIAN_RESULTS_STATION_1">The crew is unusually quiet. A salvage team strips the station of useful materials and checks its cargo.</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_DEAD_CREW_PIRACY_CIVILIAN_RESULTS_STATION_2">Your crew accuses you of betraying everything the Federation stands for. A salvage team is sent in to strip the station of useful materials and report on its cargo.</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_DEAD_CREW_PIRACY_CIVILIAN_RESULTS_STATION_3">You strip the ship of useful material and scan the cargo. Several crew members file formal complaints on how you handled things. Do you feel guilty?</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_DEAD_CREW_PIRACY_CIVILIAN_RESULTS_STATION_4">So many individuals died by your hand during your mission, so the death of these civilians doesn't matter, right? The crew seems to think otherwise. As expected you discover some trade goods in the depot's cargo holds.</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_DEAD_CREW_PIRACY_CIVILIAN_RESULTS_STATION_5">A heated discussion among your crew concerning your moral integrity leads to one of your crewmen pulling a blaster on you. You draw faster and your crew member slumps dead to the cold metal floor. No one on the bridge says a word, everyone just returns to their stations. You go to your quarters and wonder how it has come to this.</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_DEAD_CREW_PIRACY_CIVILIAN_RESULTS_STATION_6">You keep telling yourself this was necessary for the mission, but you can't help but feel guilty. The looks your crew give you don't help either. The depot was fit for refueling ships. You take the fuel out of the storage. You also take all the scrap you can manage and request a report on the cargo.</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_DEAD_CREW_PIRACY_CIVILIAN_RESULTS_STATION_7">There are no more life signs remaining on the ship and you send in a salvage team. One of your crew members sends a formal complaint over the comms, arguing that this operation was unnecessary and against Federation protocols. They decide to desert your mission and stay on board the depot.</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_DEAD_CREW_PIRACY_CIVILIAN_RESULTS_STATION_8">Your crew is much more silent during the salvage operation than usual, no one talks to you anymore unless given orders. They find a weapon system on the station. The civilians must have been conducting some illegal arms trading off the board. You take the weapon for your ship.</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_DEAD_CREW_PIRACY_CIVILIAN_RESULTS_RISKLESS_STATION_1">Your crew has no problems with resorting to piracy. A salvage team strips the station of useful materials and checks its cargo.</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_DEAD_CREW_PIRACY_CIVILIAN_RESULTS_RISKLESS_STATION_3">You strip the ship of useful materials. Your crew follows their orders. The salvage team report on some cargo in the station's holds.</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_DEAD_CREW_PIRACY_CIVILIAN_RESULTS_RISKLESS_STATION_4">Your crew agrees this was ugly, but necessary. You are able to take the fuel out of the station's storage. You also take all the scrap you can manage.</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_DEAD_CREW_PIRACY_CIVILIAN_RESULTS_RISKLESS_STATION_5">Your crew does not question your course of action. You are able to take the fuel out of the station's storage. You also take all the scrap you can manage and request a report on the cargo.</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_DEAD_CREW_PIRACY_CIVILIAN_RESULTS_RISKLESS_STATION_6">Your crew doesn't care any more than you do about the civilians. They throw the bodies out of the airlock and later find a weapon system on board. With everyone dead, you can take it for your ship.</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_TE_LOOT_GOODS_CIVILIAN_STATION_1">The station was storing common goods. You prepare to take the containers on board.</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_TE_LOOT_GOODS_CIVILIAN_STATION_4">The station was mainly storing industrial equipment. Your crew loads the machines into the cargo holds.</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_TE_LOOT_GOODS_CIVILIAN_STATION_6">The station was storing food supplies produced in the nearby colonies. Your crew loads the shipment into the cargo holds.</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_TE_LOOT_GOODS_CIVILIAN_STATION_8">The station was dealing in valuable consumer goods. The crew carefully secures them in the cargo holds.</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_TE_LOOT_GOODS_CIVILIAN_STATION_9">The station was hiding various things banned in Rebel space. Someone will pay good money for that stuff.</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_TE_LOOT_GOODS_CIVILIAN_STATION_10">Most of the goods have been damaged in the fight, but a few crates with rare crystal artifacts remain miraculously undamaged. You have never seen things like this. You order the crew to secure the cargo in the holds and bring one of the artifacts to your quarters. They are quite fascinating.</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_TE_LOOT_GOODS_CIVILIAN_STATION_11">The station is equipped with a simple cloning facility, where alien organs are grown in tubes. You make off with the living goods.</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_TE_LOOT_GOODS_CIVILIAN_STATION_12">The station was in the process of being extended. You make off with the construction materials.</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_TE_LOOT_GOODS_CIVILIAN_STATION_13">The station was dedicated to breeding multi-purpose plankton. You secure some of it in containers and take the strange stuff on board.</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_TE_LOOT_GOODS_CIVILIAN_STATION_14">The station was storing oxygen to restock ships passing though this system. You prepare to take a few of the tanks on board.</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_TE_LOOT_GOODS_CIVILIAN_STATION_15">The station was mainly storing water for extra planetary use. Your crew loads some of the tanks into the cargo holds.</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_TE_LOOT_GOODS_CIVILIAN_STATION_16">The station was producing modified plant seeds. Your crew loads a few metric tons into the holds.</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_TE_LOOT_GOODS_CIVILIAN_STATION_17">The station is equipped with an extensive hydroponics lab. Your crew makes off with the latest harvest.</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_TE_LOOT_GOODS_CIVILIAN_STATION_18">The station was storing entertainment gear. Your crew loads the shipment into the cargo holds.</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_TE_LOOT_GOODS_CIVILIAN_STATION_19">The station was hosing a research lab. The crew carefully strips it of the dedicated equipment. You won't be able to make any use of the exotic machines aboard, but maybe you can sell this stuff somewhere.</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_TE_LOOT_GOODS_CIVILIAN_STATION_20">Strangely enough, the station was storing an extensive DNA database in a hidden clonelab. Someone will pay good money for this.</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_TE_LOOT_GOODS_CIVILIAN_STATION_21">Most of the goods have been damaged in the fight, but a few crates with rare archaeological relics. You can only hope to find a good buyer for this stuff.</text>
<text name="ce_event_GANG_SHAKEDOWN_c1_e">"Shiny! Be on your way then, Federation person."</text>
<text name="ce_event_GANG_SHAKEDOWN_c2_e">You program an attack course. You won't let yourself be threatened by petty criminals.</text>
<text name="ce_event_GANG_SHAKEDOWN_c3_e">"All right then. The fleet will pay us better anyway." The ship charges its FTL and you do the same. They will surely give your position away to the Rebel fleet.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_GANG_SHAKEDOWN_TEXT_1">Since interstellar authority has broken down, pirates, militia units and local gangs share control of the coreworlds and keep a relative stable peace. A local banger crew seem to know who you are. They threaten to sell you out to the Rebel fleet and demand some scrap to keep quiet.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_GANG_SHAKEDOWN_TEXT_2">A small gang ship hails you, "This is our beacon. Some say you are a wanted criminal, but you don't look like a cool one. Got some scrap? Else the Rebels might get a little tip on your whereabouts soon, if you get my meaning..." This seems to be some kind of shakedown.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_GANG_SHAKEDOWN_TEXT_3">A militia ship with gang markings hails, "Federation!? No way! You are that ship everyone is looking for! You better hand over some scrap or we gonna put the fleet on your ass within a standard hour."</text>
<text name="ce_textList_GANG_SHAKEDOWN_TEXT_4">A ship with the markings of a local gang jumps in shortly after you. They hail, "Hey there, glad we caught up with you. You are this rogue Federation ship, right? The Rebels would pay a lot for some intel on your whereabouts. What's about you make us a better offer first?" They giggle.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_GANG_TEXT_1">"Hey you, Fed cruiser! Glad you came, these bangers won't leave us alone." The hail comes from a nearby civilian ship. You don't have to decide if you want to help: The gang ship already changed course engages you.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_GANG_TEXT_2">As local authority has broken down, some petty criminals have organized small gangs. Most of their members are simply common pirates with fancier ships.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_GANG_TEXT_3">A ship with gang markings demands your surrender. You doubt these fools will be missed.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_GANG_TEXT_4">You spot a gang ship looting a small civilian freighter. There is doubt that they destroyed it themselves, but as you scan them they react aggressively and move in to attack.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_GANG_TEXT_5">After your jump drive cooled down, a ship of a local gang sends a message: "You want to fight?" They definitely want to and come at you dead on.</text>
<text name="ce_event_GANG_MANTIS">A small gang vessel hails you: "Glad you are here, friend. See that ship on your nine? That's a Mantis expedition ship. My drive is almost charged, I'll inform the militia while you hold them off, okay?" It seems you won't have much other choice.</text>
<text name="ce_event_SE_QUEST_PASSANGERS_START">While the FTL drive charges, you skim the virtual billboard of the nearby planet. A group of individuals wants to get off world, to a destination which lies almost on your route. You could make some scrap on the side by bringing them there.</text>
<text name="ce_event_SE_QUEST_PASSANGERS_START_c1">Contact them and fix a pick up point.</text>
<text name="ce_event_SE_QUEST_PASSANGERS_START_c1_e">The militia system control double checks your ship ID, but then gives you permission to land as long as you "do not cause any trouble". You put the ship down in a busy spaceport and take your passengers on board. They agree to remain in the cargo hold for the time of the journey.</text>
<text name="ce_event_SE_QUEST_PASSANGERS_START_c2">Continue on your way.</text>
<text name="ce_event_SE_QUEST_PASSANGERS_START_c2_e">One never knows what problems passengers might cause. You decide to move on.</text>
<text name="ce_event_SE_QUEST_PASSANGERS_ARRIVE">You arrived at the destination of your customers.</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_SE_QUEST_PASSANGERS_RESULTS_1">One of the major coreworlds lies in front of you. The passengers, a group of human merchants, take a public shuttle down to the surface. They were quite wealthy and you receive a nice tip for the timely delivery.</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_SE_QUEST_PASSANGERS_RESULTS_2">One of the major coreworlds lies in front of you. You land at the cheapest pad you can find but the docking fees still eat up quite a bit of your profit. Your passengers complain about "the state of the ship" as they leave. Coreworlders...</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_SE_QUEST_PASSANGERS_RESULTS_3">Your passengers, a group of local freedom fighters, point you to the station at which they have to report in. You became friends during the journey; most of them are ex-Federation. They have taken a different path, but are still offering some ammunition on top of the payment to help you out.</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_SE_QUEST_PASSANGERS_RESULTS_4">You set the ship down on a barren colony planet. Your passengers, a mining crew, head off to their next standard-year shift. After receiving the meager payment that was agreed on, you and the crew take a quick stroll in the local town. A cattle market is on.</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_SE_QUEST_PASSANGERS_RESULTS_4_c1">Buy a small herd of fine cattle.</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_SE_QUEST_PASSANGERS_RESULTS_4_c1_e">Sealing the documentation and driving the livestock into the cargo holds takes its time. You hope the animals survive all the usual breaches, fires, boarding crews and missile impacts...</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_SE_QUEST_PASSANGERS_RESULTS_4_c2">Get the ship back into orbit.</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_SE_QUEST_PASSANGERS_RESULTS_4_c2_e">You are glad to have artificial gravity under your feet again.</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_SE_QUEST_PASSANGERS_RESULTS_5">Your passengers, a group of local freedom fighters, point you to the station at which they have to report in. One of them addresses you for the first time as you dock the station, "Captain, I'm not here by my free will. These men, they will hand me over to the Rebels. Please, help me!"</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_SE_QUEST_PASSANGERS_RESULTS_5_c1_e">"Shut up!" The militia intervene. "This man is a Federation war criminal. You will open the airlock and they will leave your ship with us." They draw their weapons as a precaution.</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_SE_QUEST_PASSANGERS_RESULTS_5_c1_e_c1">Signal the intruder alert.</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_SE_QUEST_PASSANGERS_RESULTS_5_c1_e_c1_e">The Federation sympathizer manages to jump through the security doors before they fall shut between you and the militia. "Thank you, Captain!" You hear pulse rifles from within the ship and impacts resonate through the hallways as the station opens fire. Let's hope this person was worth all this.</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_SE_QUEST_PASSANGERS_RESULTS_5_c1_e_c2">Just ask for your payment.</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_SE_QUEST_PASSANGERS_RESULTS_5_c1_e_c2_e">"Here it is. We take our leave now." The group slowly retreats into the airlock, weapons still drawn. The Federation sympathizer just stares at the ground as the bulkhead doors close. Time to get out of here...</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_SE_QUEST_PASSANGERS_RESULTS_6">One of the secondary coreworlds lies in front of you. The passengers, a group of civilians, take a public shuttle down to the surface. As you count your scrap, a video message comes in.</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_SE_QUEST_PASSANGERS_RESULTS_6_c1_e">It shows a young human. "I just wanted to thank you for the nice trip I had on your ship. I bet my Rebel superior also would like to meet you." He moves closer to the screen. "We are onto you now. We will catch you!"</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_SE_QUEST_PASSANGERS_RESULTS_6_c1_e_c1_e">This is bad, your position has been compromised.</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_SE_QUEST_PASSANGERS_RESULTS_6_c1_e_c2">(Slugman Crew) Your Slug doubts that.</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_SE_QUEST_PASSANGERS_RESULTS_6_c1_e_c2_e">Your Slug calmly responds: "Yess we knew that. You really thought you were transsmitting data to your superiorss throughout the whole trip without usss knowing? They've got the wrong coordinates." The Rebel curses at the Federation and closes transmission. Your skilled Slug saved you some trouble here.</text>
<text name="ce_event_CIVILIAN_DISTRESS_RIOT">The main colony on this barren planet is in unrest. Citizens demonstrate in the street, they want to join the Rebellion and demand the resignation of their rulers. The local magistrate wanted to call in the militias with the distress call, and is quite surprised by your visit.</text>
<text name="ce_event_CIVILIAN_DISTRESS_RIOT_c1">Land the ship and investigate.</text>
<text name="ce_event_CIVILIAN_DISTRESS_RIOT_c2">(Neural Stunner) Offer to incapacitate the rioters.</text>
<text name="ce_event_CIVILIAN_DISTRESS_RIOT_c2_e">The colony counsel first rejects your offer, saying they do not want to deny their people free speech. Then a group of desperate activists storms the premise of the magistrates villa. You are contacted again on a private channel, with a generous offer. Stun projectors fully power, you come down hard and knock out the Rebel sympathizers. They are taken into custody and supplies are sent into orbit.</text>
<text name="ce_event_CIVILIAN_DISTRESS_RIOT_c3">(Lasers) Show the Rebel sympathizers what they get.</text>
<text name="ce_event_CIVILIAN_DISTRESS_RIOT_c3_e">You fly a strafing run and open fire on the rioters. The crowd scatters; many lie dead in the street. The local authorities are terrified by your actions. Some militia ships have arrived by now and one intercepts you as you get back into orbit.</text>
<text name="ce_event_CIVILIAN_DISTRESS_RIOT_c4_e">It's better not to draw too much attention here. You prepare to jump.</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_CIVILIAN_DISTRESS_RIOT_DISCUSS_1">You set the ship down near a busy protest camp. The activists declare they have no leaders, but everyone is happy to talk with you. They hope for better lives with the Rebellion. You and the crew share some stories from your journey.</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_CIVILIAN_DISTRESS_RIOT_DISCUSS_1_c1_e">It turns out that the activists share a lot of your views, while they also disagree on other points. As the FTL is almost charged you get ready for lift off. The local magistrate, an ex-Federation official, thanks your for your efforts with a small scrap donation.</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_CIVILIAN_DISTRESS_RIOT_DISCUSS_2">The protests have developed into a full out riot. The administration building is being set ablaze and militia marines are deployed to control the crowds. As you watch the chaos from a bar near the landing pad you realize that there nothing you can do here. You are just a bystander, a crisis tourist.</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_CIVILIAN_DISTRESS_RIOT_DISCUSS_2_c1_e">You get the ship back into orbit and prepare to leave.</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_CIVILIAN_DISTRESS_RIOT_DISCUSS_3">The situation in town is tense. Your arrival is met with hostile remarks by the locals. You realize that anti-Federation propaganda has been spread here for quite a while and decide that you better get back to the ship quickly.</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_CIVILIAN_DISTRESS_RIOT_DISCUSS_3_c1_e">As you take off you spot a group of armed individuals on a nearby roof. They have an RPG 7000! You put full power to the thrusters, but cannot evade the rocket. Luckily, spaceship hull armor can take such a hit easily.</text>
<text name="ce_event_CIVILIAN_RELAX">You arrive at one of the major coreworld planets. Some of its settlements have several million inhabitants. Your crew is exhausted and traumatized from the journey, the endless work and all the fighting. Your First Mate formally suggests giving a shore leave.</text>
<text name="ce_event_CIVILIAN_RELAX_c1">Spend one jump cycle on the planet to relax.</text>
<text name="ce_event_CIVILIAN_RELAX_c2">Tell them to hold on just a little longer. The Federation depends on us.</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_CIVILIAN_RELAX_RESULTS_1">You spend the time on the planet in a fancy club, partying with the crew like there is no tomorrow. Which might be actually true for some, or all of you. Waking up with a bad headache, you prepare to get the ship back on route. Your team is grateful for the day of distraction.</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_CIVILIAN_RELAX_RESULTS_2">While your crewmen do their own things you spend the time on the planet in a small bar. After some drinks you get into a conversation with an ex-Federation officer. Times have changed. You talk about the old days and in the end she agrees to share some local sector maps to help you out.</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_CIVILIAN_RELAX_RESULTS_3">While your crewmen do their own things you spend the evening on the planet in a local canteen.</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_CIVILIAN_RELAX_RESULTS_4">You stay on board the ship to further plan your journey. As your crew returns, one of them brings a guest. It turns out they have become lovers and the unknown individual even wants to join your cause in order to be able to stay with your crew member.</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_CIVILIAN_RELAX_RESULTS_4_c1">"Whatever. Welcome on board."</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_CIVILIAN_RELAX_RESULTS_4_c1_e">You give a quick speech about crew discipline, the dangers of your mission and that everyone will be treated the same on board. Your crewman's partner is still eager to join. Can love bloom in outer space? Perhaps soon you will find out.</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_CIVILIAN_RELAX_RESULTS_4_c2">"This isn't exactly protocol. Sorry."</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_CIVILIAN_RELAX_RESULTS_4_c2_e">"I said NO!" ... Such stuff on board only causes problems and might even endanger the mission. They say goodbye to each other on the cargo ramp while you prepare the ship for take off.</text>
<text name="ce_event_CE_QUEST_CURATOR_START">You arrive at a quiet part of the sector. To your surprise the scanners pick up an autonomous drone, alone in space. The thing actually hails your ship, claiming it has a proposal to make.</text>
<text name="ce_event_CE_QUEST_CURATOR_START_c1">Open a channel and hear what the robot has to say.</text>
<text name="ce_event_CE_QUEST_CURATOR_START_c2">A talking drone? How quaint. Let's move on.</text>
<text name="ce_event_CE_QUEST_CURATOR_START_c2_e">The drones protests in text form, but that does not keep you from scraping it as you pass into your jump vector. Free drone parts.</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_CE_QUEST_CURATOR_START_OFFER_1_c1_e">"Would you be interested in joining our little club of explorers? You will roam the galaxy in search for strange treasures, a great adventure!"</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_CE_QUEST_CURATOR_START_OFFER_1_c1_e_c1">Agree to collect some of the artifacts the Curator is looking for.</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_CE_QUEST_CURATOR_START_OFFER_1_c1_e_c1_e">The drone sounds elated. "Excellent, Captain! You will be duly compensated, according to the amount of items you secure. Transmitting a catalog with items of interest... Attaching locations of my sisters as well... See you."</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_CE_QUEST_CURATOR_START_OFFER_1_c1_e_c1_e_c1_e">The drone floats away. One of the artifacts can be found a few light years away. You tag the location on your map.</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_CE_QUEST_CURATOR_START_OFFER_1_c1_e_c2">No time for mercenary work. There is vital information which needs to get to the Federation!</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_CE_QUEST_CURATOR_START_OFFER_1_c1_e_c2_e">The drone puts on a disappointed sounding voice. "This could have been an adventure for a lifetime, Captain. I suppose I will have to wait for another ship and crew." As the Curator's drone moves away from your ship, you get ready to leave this section of space.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_CE_QUEST_CURATOR_START_OFFER_DRONE_OFFER_TEXT_1">"Greeting, Captain. I am 127 Praf, an autonomous AI drone. I represent an individual of great fame in this part of the galaxy, a collector of interstellar artifacts known as "The Curator." My AI brethren and I seek to recruit help to enlarge our master's collection."</text>
<text name="ce_textList_CE_QUEST_CURATOR_START_OFFER_DRONE_OFFER_TEXT_2">"Greeting, Captain. I am Lux, an autonomous AI drone.

<text name="ce_textList_CE_PDS_CIV_TEXT_1">Another busy core planet lies in front of you. The planetary government has outsourced its defense sector to private contractors. It seems these corporate people are on more than friendly terms with the Rebels.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_CE_PDS_CIV_TEXT_2">After jump completion, the dock control of this densely populated planet hails you, "The Rebel fleet has put a price on your head. You are a wanted criminal. We will bring you in, alive or dead". It seems you won't make many friends here.</text>

<text name="ce_textList_FINISH_BEACON_TEXT_6">You arrive near the main planet of the sector. A major jump relay located here allows space ships to perform extreme long-range jumps.

<text name="ce_textList_FINISH_BEACON_TEXT_7">You've arrived at a busy Long-Range Beacon - A massive jump relay that can throw ships a great distance. You can use this installation to travel to another sector.</text>

<text name="ce_textList_FINISH_BEACON_TEXT_13">Several stations were guarding this long-range relay, but they have been devastated by Fleet bombardment. Smoldering debris bumps against your shields. The main installation barely survived the battle.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_FINISH_BEACON_TEXT_14">You reached another long range beacon. Some kind of battle fleet must have come through here lately: The surrounding guard outposts are unresponsive and show no lifesigns. Lucky for you, the invaders left the relay intact.

<text name="ce_textList_FINISH_BEACON_TEXT_15">After some extensive scanning, you find an antique long-range jump node in this system. Miraculously, the installation is still powered and functional.</text>

<text name="ce_textList_TIPS_LIST_1">TIP: Death -   Remember, losing is part of the fun!  ...  No, I'm serious...</text>
<text name="ce_textList_TIPS_LIST_3">TIP: Exits -  It's tempting to rush for the sector exits, but exploring is the only way to upgrade your ship. Try and get as much out of each sector as possible.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_TIPS_LIST_8">TIP: Selling -  Weapons, drones, and augments can be sold for 1/2 the purchasing price at stores. Click on the SELL tab at the top.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_TIPS_LIST_9">TIP: Power Bars - Upgraded systems can be helpful even if you don't have enough reactor power to use them; they still absorb one damage.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_TIPS_LIST_11">TIP: Cloaking -  Cloaking prevents enemies from firing on your ship or charging their weapons. It also causes all currently flying shots to miss your ship.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_TIPS_LIST_13">TIP: Oxygen -  If the ship's room color changes from tan to red, it means you're losing oxygen. Crew will be damaged and fires will burn out in rooms with an orange border.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_TIPS_LIST_14">TIP: Shield Piercing -  Missiles ignore shields. Use missiles to damage a powerful ship's Shield System. Just remember that Defense Drones can shoot down missiles!</text>
<text name="ce_textList_TIPS_LIST_17">TIP: Evasion -  Evading enemy shots is crucial but it requires functioning engines AND a pilot. Having someone man the engines will increase your evasion as well.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_TIPS_LIST_20">TIP: Beams -  Beam weapons do damage based on the number of rooms they hit.  Each Shield bubble will block 1 damage of a beam; it's best to use beams when their shields are down.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_TIPS_LIST_22">TIP: Health -  Pay attention to your crew's health! Use the medbay to keep them patched up.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_TIPS_LIST_26">TIP: Asteroids -  Fighting in asteroid fields is dangerous, but use it to your advantage. Take out enemy shields and let the rocks take care of the rest.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_TIPS_LIST_27">TIP: Nebulae -  Passing through a Nebula will allow you to temporarily slow down the fleet advancement but they contain their own unique dangers.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_TIPS_LIST_28">TIP: Solar Flares - Solar flares will cause hull damage in addition to starting fires. Make sure your shields are up to help mitigate this effect.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_TIPS_LIST_29">TIP: Score - Your score is based on how many ships you defeat, the number of beacons explored, and your total scrap collection.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_TIPS_LIST_30">TIP: Hotkeys -  You can charge or arm weapons using number hotkeys:  The Weapon Slots are 1-4 on your keyboard, and the Drones are 5-7 (customizable in the options).</text>
<text name="ce_textList_TIPS_LIST_33">TIP: Font Size - Pressing +/- (customizable in options) will let you change the event text size.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_TIPS_LIST_34">TIP: Rebel fleet - The rebel fleet (represented by the red circle on the map) moves closer to your position every time you jump. Certain events can slow or speed up their movement speed.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_TIPS_LIST_35">TIP: Weapon Order - Rearrange a weapon or drone schematic by dragging it into the desired position. The left-most slot will be the last to power down if the system is damaged.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_TIPS_LIST_36">TIP: Ion Weapons - Ion weapons de-power and lock a System for a time. If they hit the enemy shields they deal their stun damage directly to the Shields System.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_TIPS_LIST_37">TIP: Bomb Weapons - Bombs teleport directly onto either ship. They bypass Shields AND Defense Drones. However they affect crew and Systems; they do no damage to the ships hull.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_TIPS_LIST_38">TIP: Door Subsystem - Upgrading your doors once will greatly reduce the chance fire will spread between rooms. Upgrading them again will cause doors to significantly slow boarder movement.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_TIPS_LIST_39">TIP: Armed Space Stations - Enemy space stations have strong hulls but usually no engines. That means they can not move and therefore are unable to dodge. Use this to your advantage.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_TIPS_LIST_40">TIP: Light Lasers - These lasers are good for killing crew, but can not deplete shields or damage systems and ship hull. Use them to empty ships of personnel or to support your boarders and keep an eye on your crews health when you are taking fire from light lasers.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_TIPS_LIST_41">TIP: Auto Lasers - These lasers seem weak on their own, but can make formidable support weapons if you can deplete the enemy shields with other guns.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_TIPS_LIST_42">TIP: Burst Missile Launchers - Some missile launchers fire multiple weak projectiles. These weapons are perfect to take out critical systems on fast moving, well shielded enemies.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_TIPS_LIST_43">TIP: Effectors - These electronic-warfare devices surpass shields, allowing you to shut down enemy systems at will. Use them to target key systems.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_TIPS_LIST_44">TIP: Artillery Class Weapons - Some weapons have devastating firepower, but cool down slowly and cannot deplete shields effectively. They work great against enemies with low evasion, but might need support weapons to deplete enemy shields.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_TIPS_LIST_45">TIP: Focused Beams - Some beam weapons deal high damage, but can an only hit one room. Use them to get through enemy shields or to damage fast moving opponents.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_TIPS_LIST_46">TIP: Alternative Targets - Keep in mind that Weapons and Shields are not always the prime targets. Some enemies might rely on different systems for attacking or defending themselves. Target them accordingly.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_TIPS_LIST_47">TIP: Scouts - These ships only have weak hulls, but can bring a lot of firepower to the fight.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_TIPS_LIST_48">TIP: Fighters, Bombers and Assault Classes - These ships are well rounded and have no special strengths and weaknesses. Like all enemies, their equipment and weapon load-out depends on the faction they belong to.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_TIPS_LIST_49">TIP: Troopships - These ships are almost always equipped with teleporters and transport a lot of personnel. Get your crew ready for close combat when you encounter them.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_TIPS_LIST_50">TIP: Interceptors - These fast ships can dodge a lot of your attacks. Target their helm or engines first to slow them down. Burst weapons and powerful beams can make short work of them.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_TIPS_LIST_51">TIP: Medevacs - These medical support ships are always equipped with proper medbays and usually transport extra crew, which makes boarding them quite difficult.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_TIPS_LIST_52">TIP: Repair Ships - These slow and fragile support ships are always equipped with various repair drones, which makes damaging them quite difficult. They might even repair hull damage throughout the fight.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_TIPS_LIST_53">TIP: Drone Carriers - These slow ships will use attack drones as their primary mean of attacking, but can't power a lot of conventional weaponry.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_TIPS_LIST_54">TIP: Hunter Classes - Some enemy ships are specialized for injuring and killing your crew and might even use weaponry designed for that purpose. Keep an eye on your crew's health and make good use of your medbay when encountering them.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_TIPS_LIST_55">TIP: Exotic Ships - Some enemy ships are specialized in unique ways and might be equipped with distinct armaments or equipment. Try to discover their capabilities and weaknesses to deal with them effectively. You can always flee from an encounter if you are not sure what you are dealing with.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_TIPS_LIST_56">TIP: Anti-Hull Weapons - Some weapons and drones deal extra damage when fired at empty rooms. While they perform poorly against small ships, they can come in handy against enemies with a lot of hullpoints and empty rooms, like space stations and cruisers.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_TIPS_LIST_57">TIP: Capital Ships - Your cruiser is not designed to fight every type of ship. If you feel that your enemy outright outclasses you, then trying to flee might be your best bet.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_TIPS_LIST_58">TIP: Rebel Cruisers - When the fleet catches up with you, you might have to fight strong Rebel elite cruisers and the Rebels will also station these ships at exit beacons.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_TIPS_LIST_59">TIP: Fighting Rebel Cruisers - Taking out Rebel cruisers can throw the fleet into disarray and buy you some time, but fleeing from these powerful ships might often be the better option.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_TIPS_LIST_60">TIP: Tech Missile Launchers - Some missile weapons can scramble enemy defense systems and will only be shot down by level 2 defense drones.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_TIPS_LIST_61">TIP: Trade Routes - Trading is most lucrative between sectors of different types (civilian, hostile, hazard). Check the sector map and plan your route through the sectors accordingly to increase your profits.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_TIPS_LIST_62">TIP: Trade Goods Level - Trade goods come at different scarcities (basic, common, uncommon, rare, legendary). This puts them into different price ranges. Buying more expansive goods requires greater investments, but also nets bigger profits with one haul.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_TIPS_LIST_63">TIP: Cargo Space - Trade goods take up Augmentation slots. Make sure you have enough cargo space when buying commodities. If you realize that your holds are already full then you can still sell the goods back to the shop with minimal scrap loss.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_TIPS_LIST_64">TIP: Selling Goods - Trade goods sell prices are negotiable, resulting in slightly random profit from each haul. Sell prices are more likely to sway in your favor when selling goods with higher rarity levels.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_TIPS_LIST_65">TIP: Supply and Demand - Trade goods can not be event-sold in sectors where they are for sale. You can still quick-sell the commodities at the shop to free up cargo space, but delivering them to other sectors and then selling them in trade events makes better money.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_TIPS_LIST_66">TIP: Trading Time - Negotiating prices and transferring cargo usually takes a lot of time. If you engage in trade at shops the Rebel fleet will catch up with you faster.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_TIPS_LIST_67">TIP: Cargo Teleporters - Stores sometimes have cargo teleporters, allowing you to sell and buy goods without loosing time. Stores in trade-affine sector types (most civilian) are more likely to have cargo teleporters.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_TIPS_LIST_68">TIP: Sector Trade Capacity - Some sectors are more suitable for trading then others. Far out places and regions with disrupted economy have less to offer. Stable core regions, on the other hand, sell and buy a lot of goods at good prices.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_TIPS_LIST_69">TIP: High Demand - There is always a region of space where even the most ordinary of goods are in high demand. If you know where your freight is really needed you can make very high profits with a single haul.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_TIPS_LIST_70">TIP: Quick Selling - You can always sell your trade goods directly to the shop, but only at bad prices. This way you can quickly get rid of excess cargo.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_TIPS_LIST_71">TIP: Piracy - Resorting to piracy will disillusion your crew and might make them desert your cause, but can also net you additional scrap and trade goods.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_TIPS_LIST_72">TIP: Pirate Factions - Some aliens are known to prey on defenseless ships on a regular basis. The crew of these factions' ships will not revolt if you engage in piracy.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_TIPS_LIST_73">TIP: Slow Reloading Defense Drone - Some defense drones reload slow and cannot take a shot at every incoming missile, they will however take out the fist missile fired at you, doing that at minimal power requirements. They are also ineffective when defending against asteroids.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_TIPS_LIST_74">TIP: Fast Reloading Defense Drone - More advanced defense drones fire very fast and should be able to take down multiple incoming projectiles at once.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_TIPS_LIST_75">TIP: Light Drones - These drones are designed to injure enemy crew, but cannot damage the enemy ship's hull. They are especially useful to soften up resistance before your boarders move in.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_TIPS_LIST_76">TIP: Ion Drones - These drones are mainly useful for ionizing enemy shields, as you can not control where they aim.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_TIPS_LIST_77">TIP: Ship Size - The amount of rooms an enemy ship has factors into how effective certain drones are against them. Most drones excel when attacking smaller ships, because they are more likely to hit crew and systems.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_TIPS_LIST_78">TIP: Cargo Ships and Freighters - These ships often carry valuable cargo. They possess little firepower and rely on powerful engines and jump drives to avoid confrontations.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_TIPS_LIST_79">TIP: Hazard Sectors - The Rebel fleet will struggle to pursue you through these sectors full of ion storms and asteroid fields. Exploring them isn't always advisable. Hazard Sectors have little infrastructure and are full of dangers.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_TIPS_LIST_80">TIP: Civilian Coreworlds - These peaceful sectors offer a lot of opportunities to work and trade, but be careful, losing the Rebel fleet will be harder in populated areas and you never know who might give your position away to them.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_TIPS_LIST_81">TIP: Federation Controlled Sectors - Federation controlled sectors will be under Rebel attack when you arrive. There will be fierce fighting almost everywhere.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_TIPS_LIST_82">TIP: UI Prompts - Some weapons leave no visible traces, but your ship's computer will inform you about their activity with small UI prompts. The computer will also warn you about dangerous weapons fired at you via these prompts.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_TIPS_LIST_83">TIP: Weapon Spread - Certain weapons, like swarm missile launchers and heavy scatter lasers, spread their projectiles over a wide area. This way they deal good damage to the ship's hull, but less damage to crew and systems inside the ship.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_TIPS_LIST_84">TIP: Mines - Space mines explode in close proximity to ships, dealing maximum damage to the hull. They cannot damage systems or crew and travel quite slow. Use them to finish off weakened enemies.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_TIPS_LIST_85">TIP: Combat Augments - Combat augments can disrupt your opponent's systems during battle. Without special equipment your ship can only power one of these augments at the same time.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_TIPS_LIST_86">TIP: Production Augments - Some augments can help you to conserve or gather resources. You need to find a beacon where you are undisturbed in order to use them.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_TIPS_LIST_87">TIP: AI Crew - Holographic crew members are not as tough as organic or partly organic beings, but they can get any job done and don't require oxygen.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_TIPS_LIST_88">TIP: Debris Fields - The destruction of bigger ships might create vast debris fields. You can choose to spend more time in order to salvage additional materials, but the Rebel fleet will catch up faster if you do so.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_TIPS_LIST_89">TIP: Minefields - Fights in Minefields will cause proximity mines to home in on your ship early in the fight. Jump away before they hit you, or use drones or engine power to counter them.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_TIPS_LIST_90">TIP: Planetary Defense Weapons - Advancing into hostile territory might confront you with heavy planetary defense weapons. These guns charge slow; it is best to jump away before they fire.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_TIPS_LIST_91">TIP: Planetary Artillery - This defense weapon charges slow but pierces all shields and can cause fires and breaches. UI prompts will inform you about its targeting cycle and can tell you which rooms it will hit.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_TIPS_LIST_92">TIP: Planetary Beams - This defense weapon charges slow but will shoot right through your shields and ship, causing breaches. UI prompts will inform you about its targeting cycle and can tell you which rooms it will hit.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_TIPS_LIST_93">TIP: Rebel Point Defense System - If the fleet catches up with you the Rebels might consider finishing you off with a long range artillery barrage. Their PDS weapons charge faster than planetary defenses, try to get away in time.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_TIPS_LIST_94">TIP: Utility Bombs - Some bombs are designed to be beamed into your own ship, but they can still miss. If you want to make sure that they hit you will have to de-power your engines before firing them.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_TIPS_LIST_95">TIP: Sector Names - Sector names contain key words that give away which faction controls them. In time you will get a feel for what sector type to expect.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_TIPS_LIST_96">TIP: Industrial Sectors - These nebula type sectors feature large, hazard rich dust clouds that might often best be avoided, unless you want to risk salvaging the derelict equipment that can often be found within them.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_TIPS_LIST_97">TIP: Quarantine Sectors - Some civilian sectors are under lockdown after dangerous diseases have spread. The plague might take its toll on your crew but many people also will want to leave the system and might join you.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_TIPS_LIST_98">TIP: AI Controlled Sectors - These sectors are taken over by rogue combat AIs. The all-consuming nano-bot clouds that these AIs command are one of the most hazardous places in the galaxy.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_TIPS_LIST_99">TIP: Crew Interaction - An old Federation proverb says: "If you get to a place with nothing else to do, you can always just chat with your crew."</text>
<text name="ce_textList_TIPS_LIST_100">TIP: Crew Morale - Maintaining a good relationship with your crew is good for morale. And conversing regularly with your crew might open you all kinds of possibilities.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_TIPS_LIST_101">TIP: Crew Background - Most of your crewmen will have been around in the galaxy for some time. Conversing with certain crew in certain sectors might result in interesting reveals.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_TIPS_LIST_102">TIP: Acid Clouds - These industrial hazards will damage your ship while charging your FTL drive. Time consuming activities like salvaging and the usage of certain augments will result in more damage.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_TIPS_LIST_103">TIP: Pollution - These industrial smog clouds will affect your ship's sensors and clog the engines. Pollution hazards can vary in density, more dense clouds will have stronger effects on engines and sensors.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_TIPS_LIST_104">TIP: Nano-Bot Clouds - Nanite swarms are capable of disassembling your hull and can disrupt all systems. This nebula hazard usually won't affect the enemy ships and should best be avoided entirely.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_TIPS_LIST_105">TIP: Black Holes - Jumping near a black hole is actually much less dangerous than it sounds. However, you will need to spend more fuel to escape its gravitational pull.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_TIPS_LIST_106">TIP: Anomalies - These rare, unexplainable hazards will jam your sensors, drone communication and weapon targeting.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_TIPS_LIST_107">TIP: Ion Barriers - This curious space phenomena create massive barriers that emit strong ion fields. Your shields will be weakened near them.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_TIPS_LIST_108">TIP: Missile Drone Defense - Be aware that your own defense drones can also intercept the slow missiles fired by anti-ship missile drones.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_TIPS_LIST_109">TIP: Mine Defense - Defense drones can easily pick off space mines that approach your ship. This is of course especially usefully if you happen to jump into a minefield.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_TIPS_LIST_110">TIP: Cloaked Projectiles - Some weapons fire cloaked missiles or drop stealth mines. These projectiles can only be intercepted by level 2 defense drones.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_TIPS_LIST_111">TIP: Enemy Combat Augments - Enemy combat augments work just like the ones deployed by you. Discovering the effects and limitations of different combat augments can teach you how to defend yourself against them.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_TIPS_LIST_112">TIP: Ice Fields - Ice fields exist in remote areas far away from active stars. These areas have almost no background radiation to speak of, which makes cloaking devices useless and hiding impossible within them.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_TIPS_LIST_113">TIP: Zoltan Diplomacy - Commanding a ship of the wise Zoltan will give you a natural degree of authority. You will be able to negotiate favorable surrender offers and find peaceful resolutions for many conflicts.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_TIPS_LIST_114">TIP: Slug "Flexibility" - The Federation is well known to use Slug auxiliaries for their dirty work. Your crew will not expect you to stick to the rules if you command a Slug vessel.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_TIPS_LIST_115">TIP: Player Surrender - Remember that you often can try to surrender if you are actively attacked. This might cost you some resources, but can save you life in certain situations.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_TIPS_LIST_116">TIP: Breaking Ceasefire Agreements - Attacking an opponent whose surrender offer has been accepted constitutes an intergalactic war crime. This might disturb your crew a bit.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_TIPS_LIST_117">TIP: Making Surrender Offers - Bigger compensation offers will increase the chance of your surrender being accepted. Most opponents will always accept a good enough offer.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_TIPS_LIST_118">TIP: Trustworthiness of Opponents - Not all your opponents will obey to the general etiquette of space combat. Certain factions might attack you again after you transfered a surrender offer.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_TIPS_LIST_119">TIP: Outposts - These military stations are well armed. Prepare for a tough fight when happening upon one.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_TIPS_LIST_120">TIP: Checkpoints - Checkpoint stations are often attacked and are therefore equipped with clone bays to protect their staff. They can have various other systems as well.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_TIPS_LIST_121">TIP: EW Platforms - Electronic Warfare stations are always equipped with hacking systems. Be prepared to deal with system disruption when engaging them.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_TIPS_LIST_122">TIP: Hives and Broodstations - Some factions heavily rely on cloning facilities to swell their ranks. When you find yourself near one of their cloning stations you will have to deal with almost endless waves of boarders.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_TIPS_LIST_123">TIP: Surveyors and Instigators - Some ship classes rely on mind control systems to force your crew to sabotage your ship. You will have to somehow deal with your turned crewmen if you encounter them.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_TIPS_LIST_124">TIP: Trade Advantage - Trading might seem like a waste of time at first, but keep in mind that it is much less risky than roaming around the sector.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_TIPS_LIST_125">TIP: Artillery System - The expensive artillery system you can buy at stores will equip your ship with its signature artillery weapon, often providing a strong boost for your offense.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_TIPS_LIST_126">TIP: Faction Artillery - Buy the artillery system to discover the various artillery guns available. Certain ships might receive different kinds of artillery.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_TIPS_LIST_127">TIP: Artillery Offense - Some ships have access to devastating artillery, but depend on normal weapons to weaken enemy defenses.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_TIPS_LIST_128">TIP: Non-Lethal Artillery - Some artillery weapons deal no damage, but nevertheless provide great advantages in combat, such as ionizing enemy ships or incapacitating crew.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_TIPS_LIST_129">TIP: Combat Events - A lot of things can happen in ship-to-ship combat. Don't let your guard down.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_TIPS_LIST_130">TIP: Combat Augment Power Cost - The energy cost of combat augments can be offset with the internal generator augment. You can engineer it at empty beacons if you have combat augments.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_TIPS_LIST_131">TIP: Auto Sectors - This sectors are under the control of automated construction ships. You will rarely encounter manned ships here.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_TIPS_LIST_132">TIP: Pirate Homeworlds - Strong pirate cruisers roam the pirate strongholds. Better come prepared.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_TIPS_LIST_133">TIP: Rock Sectors - Extremely tough stations and many missile wielding enemies can be encountered in this sectors. The Black Hole hazard is also common here.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_TIPS_LIST_134">TIP: Mantis Sectors - The Mantis will often try to overwhelm you with boarders. Their brood stations and convoys can teleport almost infinite amounts of warriors to your ship.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_TIPS_LIST_PC_23">TIP: Trade Routes - Trading is most lucrative between civilian (green) and hostile (red) sectors. Check the sector map and plan your route through the sectors accordingly to increase your profits.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_TIPS_LIST_PC_24">TIP: Goods Value - Trade goods come at different scarcities, which range from very basic to rare. This puts them into different price ranges. Buying more expansive goods requires greater investments, but also nets bigger profits with one haul.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_TIPS_LIST_PC_25">TIP: Cargo Space - Trade goods take up Augmentation slots. Make sure you have enough cargo space when buying commodities.

<text name="ce_textList_TIPS_LIST_PC_26">TIP: Selling Goods - When you sell your cargo at shops, you will first negotiate a price and get an advance payment. Then you have to sell the goods at the shop to receive the rest of your scrap. [Not doing this means you are cheating.]</text>
<text name="ce_textList_TIPS_LIST_PC_27">TIP: Supply and Demand - Trade goods are never bought at good prices in the sectors where they are for sale. You can still sell the commodities at the shop to free up cargo space and make quick scrap, but delivering them to other sectors makes better money.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_TIPS_LIST_PC_31">TIP: Quick Selling - You can always sell your trade goods directly to the shop, but only at very bad prices. This way you can quickly get rid of excess cargo.</text>

<text name="ce_eventList_REBEL_HELPERS_SUPPLIES_REBEL_4">The supplies appears to be mostly equipment meant for automated farming, but you can make use of it. As you leave, you receive a message: "This is why the Rebels will always have support!"</text>

<text name="ce_eventList_REBEL_HELPERS_SUPPLIES_REBEL_6">It's nothing more than small scale building construction supplies. Oh well, scrap is scrap.</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_REBEL_HELPERS_SUPPLIES_REBEL_7">As you make to jump away, an explosion rocks your ship. The cargo was booby trapped! Where the Rebels planning to covertly murder these civilians?</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_REBEL_HELPERS_SUPPLIES_DELIVER_1">The colonists are surprised that you deliver the goods back to them; some turn out to be still loyal to the galactic order. "We appreciate what you did. A lesser Officer might have made off with the supplies, leaving us to our fate in this forsaken system. We will repay you as best as we can for your compassion, but please keep quiet about what happened here."</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_REBEL_HELPERS_SUPPLIES_DELIVER_2">Many people are seen fleeing into the hills as you bring your ship down near the settlement. The colonists are surprised that you deliver the goods back to them and give your crew suspicious looks as you unload the cargo.</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_ROGUE_REBEL_SEARCH_4">After far too long spent searching, you are finally able to track him down. You go into the fight pondering just how much of a head start you've lost on the Rebel Fleet...</text>
<text name="ce_event_NEBULA_EMPTY_c6">(Hull Repair Kit) Repair some hull damage.</text>
<text name="ce_event_NEBULA_EMPTY_c12_e">Undisturbed as you are here you can lay some mines around the beacon while the FTL charges. You put up a hazard beacon as well to warn the locals. The Rebel forces will have to avoid this beacon, clear the minefield or suffer heavy damage. All possibilities will considerably delay their fleet.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_NEBULA_EMPTY_LIST_1">Once more your eyes are your only sensors. You are pretty sure you just spotted the silvery, bladed hull of a Lanius craft in the clouds, but the vessel seems to withdraw quickly. You wonder what the strange beings are doing in this nebula.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_NEBULA_EMPTY_LIST_3">Without active sensors you have no other option but to look out of the viewports in apprehension. It's eerily quiet.</text>

<text name="ce_textList_START_BEACON_NEBULA_5">Thanks to the high nebula density of this sector very little of it has been charted, and rumors of what lurks in the depths abound.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_START_BEACON_NEBULA_6">The gases that make up the nebulae in this sector threaten to impair your systems, but you have to press on.</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_CE_BOUNTY_LIST_NEBULA_1">Its the usual deal: A small backwater colony is terrorized by a local raider. The farmers collected a meager amount of ship scrap as payment and put a bounty on the pirate's head, seemingly the only way they see to escape their peril. Target: Unknown Pirate Craft. Payment: Low.</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_CE_BOUNTY_LIST_NEBULA_2">A certain pirate ship has been ambushing traders in these nebula for ages. The crews bounty has grown to a substantial amount. Target: Legendary Pirate. Payment: Medium.</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_CE_BOUNTY_LIST_NEBULA_4">This sector is barely mentioned in any star chart and remains very sparsely populated. You are not surprised that there is no demand for a mercenary here.</text>
<text name="ce_event_FLEET_EASY_NEBULA">The high amount of cruiser-sized FTL fields has caused a massive plasma anomaly to form. The Rebel fleet has literally become a raging storm. You can't see it through the nebula, but you can assume that it is right on top of you.</text>

<text name="ce_event_NEBULA_PIRATE_SMUGGLE_c3_e">They hail you, "There's no need for aggression... Perhaps this would convince you to look the other way."</text>

<text name="ce_event_NEBULA_WEAPONS_TRADER_c5_e_c4_e">The Rockmen started to use offensive chaff launchers to distract enemy defense drones during the third uprising.

<text name="ce_event_NEBULA_WEAPONS_TRADER_c5_e_c5">Buy a high tech boarding drone. [ Scrap: -65; Drone: Intruder Drone ]</text>

<text name="ce_eventList_NEBULA_WEAPONS_TRADER_LIST_1">You transfer the scrap and receive a weapon in return. Let's hope it was worth it.</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_NEBULA_WEAPONS_TRADER_LIST2_1">Once "convinced" to help he lowers the price and describes the weapon. However he eventually comes to his senses and confusedly takes back his discount. He is clearly unsure why he offered it in the first place.</text>

<text name="ce_textList_BS_EVENT_PIRATE_BLACKMARKET_NEBULA_TEXT_1">You find a shady black market station hidden in this part of the nebula. The various services these places can offer sometimes prove to be useful.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_BS_EVENT_PIRATE_BLACKMARKET_NEBULA_TEXT_2">Your discover nothing special at this beacon and your crew can spend some time just staring at the clouds, but as you are about to ignite the FTL and jump away you are suddenly hailed by a black market trading hub. They were right in front of you the whole time, hidden in the clouds, watching you. The services they offer are as sly as their behavior.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_BS_EVENT_PIRATE_BLACKMARKET_NEBULA_TEXT_3">The commander of this hidden leisure station says he can provide "services" as long as you've got the scrap.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_BS_EVENT_PIRATE_BLACKMARKET_NEBULA_TEXT_4">As you arrive at the beacon the crew is tense from all the surprises in this shrouded part of the galaxy. This time all you discover is an illegal trade station drifting through the clouds.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_BS_EVENT_PIRATE_BLACKMARKET_NEBULA_TEXT_5">This area of the nebula seems entirely empty, but as you run a second manual scan while the FTL charges you discover a small pirate black market. They answer you after your fifth hail, but a little chitchat later they reluctantly offer some rather interesting services.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_BS_EVENT_AUTO_SUICIDE_NEBULA_TEXT_1">The Rebels must have anticipated you would try to lose them within the nebula; an automated defense turret was waiting for you at the beacon.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_BS_EVENT_AUTO_SUICIDE_NEBULA_TEXT_2">A few klicks ahead, a Rebel AI turret floats right in the middle of this wide clearing in the nebula; a perfect arena for a fight to the death.</text>

<text name="ce_textList_BS_EVENT_AUTO_SUICIDE_NEBULA_TEXT_4">This part of the nebula seems to be not as uncharted as expected; an AI controlled turret is guarding the beacon. The Rebels knew ships would have to stay in its weapon range to charge their FTL. A fight will be unavoidable.</text>

<text name="ce_textList_BS_EVENT_PIRATE_NEBULA_TEXT_2">A pirate station drifts near the beacon and hails, "Look who we have here. In the end they always come to us. Our cargo scans indicate fine prizes aboard your ship, you won't leave here in one piece." They lock weapons.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_BS_EVENT_PIRATE_NEBULA_TEXT_3">Your attempts to ID the station ahead are fruitless. When you close in a little you realize that it is a fully armed pirate station that gets its weapons ready!</text>
<text name="ce_textList_BS_EVENT_PIRATE_STORM_TEXT_1">An unlicensed station has been caught in a violent plasma storm at this beacon. They seem to be holding out well enough to engage you.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_BS_EVENT_PIRATE_STORM_TEXT_2">A pirate station drifts within an ion storm. They send a hail, "Ah, finally! Our lifeboat has arrived. We've been stuck here for weeks, you know. Nothing personal, but we will take your ship by force if you don't hand it over immediately." You decide not to.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_BS_EVENT_PIRATE_STORM_TEXT_3">You jumped right into the eye of a class delta ion storm. The surrounding area is completely dark. A massive ion flash suddenly illuminates a small station with pirate markings right in front of you. It seems still functional and opens fire.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_CE_CORPORATION_NEBULA_TEXT_1">A quick scan after your arrival reveals high concentrations of fuel components in a nearby gas cloud.

You try to reason with them, but they refuse to let you charge the FTL at their beacon and insist you leave immediately with impulse engines. In the end they indeed open fire.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_CE_CORPORATION_NEBULA_TEXT_3">"This beacon is corporate property. By jumping here you agreed to our license agreement. It is within our right to requisition parts of your weaponry for customer research. Please comply." This is ridiculous. A crew vote results in the decision to teach these guys a lesson.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_NEBULA_AUTO_CRUISER_TEXT_1">You arrive at a beacon in pristine condition.

<text name="ce_textList_NEBULA_AUTO_CRUISER_CONSTRUCTION_TEXT_2">You arrive way off the mark, the local jump field proves to be completely unstable. As you move around to investigate, the reason becomes clear: The local beacon is still under construction, by a fully armed Rebel Auto-Cruiser!

<text name="ce_eventList_CE_SLAVERY_RESULTS_2_c2_e">You decide to enslave this person. None of your crew talks to you anymore unless given orders.</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_CE_SLAVERY_RESULTS_3">The slave is unwilling to submit to their fate. They snatch a blaster from an inattentive crewman and try to fight their way to the shuttle bay.</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_CE_SLAVERY_RESULTS_5">Your crew is much more silent than usual and they don't know how to interact with the slave. No one talks to you anymore unless given orders.</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_CE_SLAVERY_RESULTS_11">One of your crew members sends a formal complaint over the comms, arguing that disregarding individuals personal freedom violates the Federation sentient rights charter. The crewman already deserted your ship via an escape pod.</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_CE_SLAVERY_RESULTS_11_clone">Your clone bay obviously does not revive your crewmember since they did not die.</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_CE_SLAVERY_RESULTS_11_c2_e">On the other hand you own a slave now and they can replace the deserter. You wonder if all this is really the right course of action.</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_CE_SLAVERY_RESULTS_12">One of your crew is outraged by your decission. The crewmen deserts your ship via a shuttle and takes the slave with them. "This is enough, Sir. I will take this person to safety and then... well, maybe the Rebels actually pursue a worthy cause after all..." You try to chase the traitor, but an explosion erupts from the sensor room and you loose track of the shuttle. Sabotage!</text>
<text name="ce_event_FAMILY_RETURN_SLAVERY_REVENGE">You reach the system where the former slave's family lives and locate their home planet.</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_FAMILY_RETURN_SLAVERY_REVENGE_LIST_1">The family owns a small terraforming business. You return their family member and the matriarch offers you a substantial reward. They board your ship with a squad of corporate security. "You really thought we would pay you for trying to enslave my brother? Die, slaver-scum!" They already have sabotaged your weapon system!</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_FAMILY_RETURN_SLAVERY_REVENGE_LIST_2">The family owns a security firm. You return their child and the patron offers you a substantial reward. They board your ship with a squad of corporate security. "You really thought we would pay you? Sorry, we don't cooperate with slavers." They already have sabotaged your weapon system!</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_FAMILY_RETURN_SLAVERY_REVENGE_LIST_3">You return the former slave, but it turns out that their family is only of modest means. They transfer a meager reward and look at you only with spite upon learning what happened.</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_FAMILY_RETURN_SLAVERY_LIST_1">The family apparently owns one of the more successful trading fleets here. The patron of the family offers you a substantial reward for the safe return of their relative.</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_FAMILY_RETURN_SLAVERY_LIST_2">The family is of modest means, yet they manage to offer you a reward for your virtuous deed.</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_FAMILY_RETURN_SLAVERY_LIST_3">Overjoyed with the return of their daughter, the family of the former slaves arranges to repair your ship's hull as compensation.</text>
<text name="ce_event_FRIENDLY_SLAVER">You recognize the ship as a well known slave trader. He hails you and offers you "laborers" for cheap.</text>
<text name="ce_event_FRIENDLY_SLAVER_c1">Buy one slave and have it join your crew.</text>
<text name="ce_event_FRIENDLY_SLAVER_c1_e">The scrap is transfered and the slave prepares to get on board.</text>
<text name="ce_event_FRIENDLY_SLAVER_c2">Attack the slaver scum!</text>
<text name="ce_event_FRIENDLY_SLAVER_c2_e">Slavery cannot be forgiven. Attack!</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_FRIENDLY_SLAVER_TELEPORTER_1">You beam a small team into their holds. They work quickly to free the slaves and teleport back to your ship. One of the captives is a recently enslaved Federation officer. You throw them a weapon in preparation for the fight ahead.</text>
<text name="ce_event_BOARDERS_SUN">You arrive to find yourself extremely close to a star. You receive a message from a pirate ship, "I'm glad you arrived; our ship is damaged and we were getting desperate... I hope you don't mind if we take yours."</text>
<text name="ce_event_BOARDERS_SUN_c1">(Teleporter Disruptor) "Actually, we do mind."</text>
<text name="ce_event_BOARDERS_SUN_c1_e">"Oh, a disruption field. How quaint... You played your cards well, Captain. I guess we are at your mercy now."</text>
<text name="ce_event_BOARDERS_SUN_c1_e_c1">Open fire.</text>
<text name="ce_event_BOARDERS_SUN_c1_e_c1_e">The Captain sends a last message, "Very well, that's what I would have done."</text>
<text name="ce_event_BOARDERS_SUN_c1_e_c2">Leave them to their fate.</text>
<text name="ce_event_BOARDERS_SUN_c1_e_c2_e">"I'm sure we will meet again." They cut communication.</text>
<text name="ce_event_BOARDERS_SUN_c2_e">Hostiles are detected on board our ship. The signal strength indicates that they teleported some of their ship equipment as well. You order your crew to fend off the boarders and seize the supplies.</text>
<text name="ce_event_BOARDERS_ASTEROID">You jump into a perilous asteroid field. Worse, sensors show a pirate stronghold has locked onto our ship and is activating a teleporter.</text>
<text name="ce_event_BOARDERS_ASTEROID_c1">(Teleporter Disruptor) Activate the disruptor augment and program an escape course.</text>
<text name="ce_event_BOARDERS_ASTEROID_c1_e">You detect a lot of encrypted comm chatter after activating the disruption field. The pirates must be calling in ships. Let's hope the FTL drive is charged before any arrive.</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_FLOATING_CARGO_LIST_1">They appear to be filled with some military supplies! You take everything you can use and jettison the rest.</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_FLOATING_CARGO_LIST_3">The cargo was primarily consumer goods. You could trade this stuff for some scrap at a store.</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_FLOATING_CARGO_LIST_4">The cargo was primarily clothing, nothing particularly useful. You could still trade this stuff for some scrap though.</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_FLOATING_CARGO_LIST_5">Once you bring the cargo onto your ship a pirate bursts out of one of the crates saying, "Ugh... I was getting cramped in there. Oh, yeah! Prepare to die!" Immediately after this battle-cry your ship is filled with the sound of crates breaking open...</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_FLOATING_CARGO_LIST_6">You bring the cargo aboard. Before you have a chance to open them a pirate ship appears out of hiding and charges. At the same time, the crates fly open. Intruders aboard the ship!</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_FLOATING_CARGO_SCAN_LIST_1">The crates appear to contain consumer goods. You can trade this stuff for scrap and also salvage some from the destroyed ship.</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_FLOATING_CARGO_SCAN_LIST_2">The crates appear to contain only simple clothing, nothing particularly useful. You could still trade this stuff for scrap though and also salvage some from the destroyed ship.</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_FLOATING_CARGO_SCAN_LIST_3">Your advanced sensors are able to breach the protective barrier and scan the cargo. It appears to be filled with some military supplies! You take everything you can use.</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_PIRATE_BRIBER_WIN_1_c1_e">No mercy for this Rebels. They might give away informations about your whereabouts later.</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_PIRATE_BRIBER_WIN_4_c1">See what he has to offer.</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_PIRATE_BRIBER_WIN_4_c1_e">You bring the ship alongside and dock to trade.</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_PIRATE_BRIBER_WIN_4_c2">We don't deal with Rebel collaborators. Destroy this ship!</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_PIRATE_BRIBER_WIN_4_c2_e">You order a full broadside. The weapons chief reluctantly programs the firing solution. The weapons go off. "What? Wait, noooo!" Communication is cut as the ship's core detonates. You sweep through the debris.</text>
<text name="ce_event_CE_BOARDERS_PIRATE_SC_c2_e">You register only a single intruder aboard. What is going on?</text>
<text name="ce_event_CE_BOARDERS_PIRATE_SC_c2_e_c1_e">The boarder immediately deploys several combat AIs! It seems you are up against a well equipped commando unit.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_BS_EVENT_PIRATE_TEXT_1">As you jump into the system you find yourself right in front of a small pirate station. They are refusing all hails. Prepare for a fight.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_BS_EVENT_PIRATE_TEXT_2">Immediately after arriving in the system you are hailed by a station, "We know who you are and what you carry. You will have to get past us if you want to jump from this beacon. Except you won't."</text>
<text name="ce_textList_BS_EVENT_PIRATE_TEXT_3">This beacon lies in close proximity to a considerably well armed pirate station. You will have to stay in their weapon range if you want to charge your FTL drive... According to the confused, apparently drug influenced comm chatter you receive the pirates seem quite amused by that.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_BS_EVENT_PIRATE_TEXT_4">A station at this beacon messages you, "Greetings, assholes. We are almost out of food and fuel here. We might have more if we would trade instead of destroying every ship that comes here, but that wouldn't be so exciting, right?"</text>
<text name="ce_textList_BS_EVENT_PIRATE_TEXT_5">You barely have time to register jump completion before your ship warns you of the station with weapons locked that floats right in front of your nose.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_BS_EVENT_PIRATE_TEXT_6">You receive hail from a small station, "Thank god you are here. The last weeks were so boring. Come on, power your weapons. Let's do this!"</text>

<text name="ce_event_BS_EVENT_PIRATE_CHOICE_c2_e">"Just as good... We will take what we need from your ship's wreckage."</text>
<text name="ce_textList_BS_EVENT_PIRATE_CHOICE_TEXT_1">Upon completing your jump, you receive a message from a station on your starboard side. "Greetings and welcome to our pleasure dome! We can't find you on the list of our usual customers. For a small registration fee, we'll let you continue on your way."</text>
<text name="ce_textList_BS_EVENT_PIRATE_CHOICE_TEXT_2">As you jump into the system you find yourself right in front of a small pirate station. They are refusing all hails, but constantly transmit a scrap transfer protocol and also locked weapons. The message is pretty clear.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_BS_EVENT_PIRATE_CHOICE_TEXT_3">Immediately after arriving in the system you are hailed by a station. "Pirate hold-up, transfer-scrap-or-get-evaporated, you know the drill. Let's get this over with."</text>
<text name="ce_textList_BS_EVENT_PIRATE_CHOICE_TEXT_4">You receive hail from a small station, "Turn off your engines, this is a hold-up! Let's keep it nice and clean; no one has to get hurt here."</text>
<text name="ce_textList_BS_EVENT_PIRATE_SUICIDE_TEXT_1">As you jump in you register a dreadful looking pirate station. Its hull is reinforced with parts from various ships and the corpses of various species are attached to it as well. They are refusing all hails. Better prepare for the worst.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_BS_EVENT_PIRATE_SUICIDE_TEXT_2">After arriving in the system you are hailed, "YOU! We've been... looking... for YOU. Yes, yes exactly for you. Let's get it on!" These guys seem seriously fracked up, but you will have to stay in their range if you want to jump from this beacon.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_BS_EVENT_PIRATE_SUICIDE_TEXT_3">You receive confused comm chatter from a small pirate station. Various individuals scream into the comms, the voices modified by overlay effects. Strange music plays in the background. You don't understand what they say but they definitely don't seem friendly. After a bit they power up their weapons.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_BS_EVENT_PIRATE_SUICIDE_TEXT_4">A station at this beacon messages you, "Greetings! We hate you and will kill you now!"</text>
<text name="ce_textList_BS_EVENT_PIRATE_SUICIDE_TEXT_5">After completing the jump your ship's AI warns you of a station with considerable threat level and improvised FTL systems. Their weapons are hot and you will have to engage them to remain in beacon range.</text>

<text name="ce_textList_STORE_OUTLAW_TEXT_1">A few small ships are visible on the vidscreen, and you almost activate weapons-targeting. However, sensors indicate they are simply honest merchants. The pirates must be making you jumpy. You message them asking about their wares.</text>

<text name="ce_eventList_STORE_OUTLAW_TRAP_LIST_2_c1_e">A bystander addresses you: "You're not from around here, are you Cap? Let me tell you, you've found yourself in a bad part of town, and these guys you just saw mean business. They don't care about you fancy Federation. Lucky for you, I'm looking for a ride out of here.

<text name="ce_textList_STORE_OUTLAW_TRAP_TEXT_BOARDERS_1">You don't like this place. Various mean looking types hang around in the docking bay, following you with their gaze. The trader is uncooperative and claims to only trade in ship equipment. Then your personal terminal beeps. "Sir we have a situation here, armed pirates approach the ship, better watch your back out there." You keep your hand on your blaster while browsing the shop.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_STORE_OUTLAW_TRAP_TEXT_BOARDERS_2">There seems to be no one trading in goods here, only ship equipment is available. While looking at the gear, you see a bunch of pirate goons heading for your ship. What do these guys want?</text>
<text name="ce_textList_STORE_OUTLAW_TRAP_TEXT_SHIP_1">You don't like this place. No one is ready to trade with you, all they offer is some general ship equipment. Your first mate contacts you over the comms. "Eh captain, I know this is supposed to be trade space, but we detect enemies in grid three-seven... You better get back here immediately." Its a trap!</text>
<text name="ce_textList_STORE_OUTLAW_TRAP_TEXT_SHIP_2">After docking you head for the store. While browsing the equipment, you see several ships circling the store. Your personal terminal beeps.

<text name="ce_textList_PIRATE_HOME_FIGHT_TEXT_5">The crew wonders if you will ever find someone matching the romantic ideal of a space pirate. Most of the outlaws you encountered so far where pretty far away from being dashing rogues with a heart of gold. Just like the obviously intoxicated captain waiting at this beacon, who demands that you surrender.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_PIRATE_HOME_FIGHT_TEXT_6">According to the logs, this planet is a major base for a local smuggler ring.

<text name="ce_textList_CE_PIRATE_HOME_FIGHT_CRUISER_TEXT_6">A ship near this barren planet catches your eye. It seem far more sophisticated than the usual pirate ships with their refit layouts and makeshift arsenals. Your scans do not give you any clues about the origin of the cruiser, but they do a good job with angering the pirates.</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_C_CRUISER_PIRATE_DESTROYED_DEFAULT_1">You did it; the pirate cruiser breaks apart! Several major explosions leave only a slowly drifting debris field behind. You collect what usable material floats nearby but the wreckage is so big that more time would be necessary to salvage everything. You run a quick debris-drift analysis to see what you could gather.</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_C_CRUISER_PIRATE_DESTROYED_DEFAULT_1_c1_e">You slowly circle around the beacon a few times and have your crew keep track of all the drifting parts that seem valuable. The stuff you collect isn't bad, but if you lost some time during the salvaging.</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_C_CRUISER_PIRATE_DESTROYED_DEFAULT_1_c2_e">Time to get out of here.</text>

<text name="ce_event_C_QUEST_PIRATE_HOME_RIVALRY">A cruiser docked at this planets main gateway station contacts you on secured channels. A smiling pirate lady in a ragged uniform appears on screen. "Hey Fed-Cap, it's you! I've heard you are visiting our great sector. That is so nice of you, cause you are not part of all this petty little rivalries we have going on here. You'll be useful!"</text>
<text name="ce_event_C_QUEST_PIRATE_HOME_RIVALRY_c1_e">"So before we even consider opening fire on each other and dancing the dance of death I'd love to propose a deal. It's super simple: You go out there and murder the hell out of the Purple Tentacles clanlord. In return you get rich. Just make sure you do not mention to anyone that the Claret Skulls sent you."</text>
<text name="ce_event_C_QUEST_PIRATE_HOME_RIVALRY_c1_e_c1">"Deal!"</text>

<text name="ce_event_C_QUEST_PIRATE_HOME_RIVALRY_c1_e_c2_e">"That is pathetic, but pretty much what I expect. Run away now, Federation dog. If you are not willing to take sides in this sector you'll be always on your own."</text>
<text name="ce_event_C_QUEST_PIRATE_HOME_RIVALRY_c1_e_c3">"Maybe we just take you out instead?"</text>
<text name="ce_event_C_QUEST_PIRATE_HOME_RIVALRY_c1_e_c3_e">The whole pirate crew burst into a laughter. "What? Look around Cap: I'm the pirate president of this entire system. I command an entire army of goons that do my bidding. If you think you can come here and start trouble you'll be in over your head soon. Allow me to demonstrate..." Anti-ship batteries all around the planet power up and the cruiser's weapons come live.</text>

<text name="ce_event_C_QUEST_PIRATE_HOME_RIVALRY_LORD_c1_e">You speed towards the Purple Tentacle flagship with weapons hot. You hostile intentions are met with surprised hails, of which you answer none. Anti-ship batteries all around the planet power up and the cruiser's weapons come live.</text>

<text name="ce_event_C_QUEST_PIRATE_HOME_RIVALRY_LORD_c2_e">The local pirate lord is mildly surprised. "Is that so? You are supposed to be... some kind of assassin? I assume you do not intend to kill me then? Splendid! The Skulls are small time, but I always thought they might indeed try to pull off something like this. Well, I will inform my Tentacles. Have some pocket scrap for sharing this information. Now be on your way."</text>
<text name="ce_event_C_QUEST_PIRATE_HOME_RIVALRY_LORD_c2_e_c2_e">You turn and speed towards the Purple Tentacle flagship with weapons hot. "Oh, you silly fool." Anti-ship batteries all around the planet power up and the cruiser's weapons come live.</text>
<text name="ce_event_C_QUEST_PIRATE_HOME_RIVALRY_LORD_c3">Abandon your quest and leave before they spot you.</text>
<text name="ce_event_C_QUEST_PIRATE_HOME_RIVALRY_REWARD">You arrive at the coordinates given to you by the Claret Skulls agent. The beacon is located in empty space far away from any populated systems. Regardless, you pick up an X shaped radiation signature. It leads to a small treasure cache, containing supplies and a weapon.</text>
<text name="ce_event_C_QUEST_PIRATE_HOME_RIVALRY_LORD_LADY_KILLED">You arrive near the home-planet of the Purple Tentacles. Anti-ship batteries line the planet's orbits. You spot the pirates' flagship docked at a small trade depot.</text>
<text name="ce_event_C_QUEST_PIRATE_HOME_RIVALRY_LORD_LADY_KILLED_c1">Hail and inform them about what you did at the Claret Skull homeworld.</text>
<text name="ce_event_C_QUEST_PIRATE_HOME_RIVALRY_LORD_LADY_KILLED_c1_e">The local pirate lord is mildly surprised. "Is that so? You are supposed to be... some kind of assassin? You decided to kill that lady instead of me? Good for you! The Skulls are small time, but I always thought they might try to pull off something like this... Very well, you shall receive some pocket scrap for your insubordination. Now be on your way."</text>
<text name="ce_event_C_QUEST_PIRATE_HOME_RIVALRY_LORD_LADY_KILLED_c1_e_c2_e">Leaving a pirate overlord alive just does not fit within your mindset. You turn and speed towards the Purple Tentacle flagship with weapons hot. "Oh, you silly fool." Anti-ship batteries all around the planet power up and the cruiser's weapons come live.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_REBEL_FIGHT_DESTROYED_1">Your crew breathes a sigh of relief as you successfully repel and destroy this Rebel pursuer. You salvage its wreckage and prepare to move on.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_REBEL_FIGHT_DESTROYED_2">Another group of Rebel officers meets their end by the hand of their prime target, their wreckage only further fueling your escape.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_REBEL_FIGHT_DESTROYED_3">The familiar markings of this Rebel ship char as the insides explode into flames. You collect what you can from their remains and ready the FTL drive.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_REBEL_FIGHT_DESTROYED_4">As their vessel is torn apart from your final assault, you wonder why the Rebels became like this as you move in to scrap their ship.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_REBEL_FIGHT_DESTROYED_5">One more Rebel ship bites the dust from your efforts. You salvage what you can and prepare for the next battle.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_AUTO_FIGHT_DESTROYED_1">Another automated ship is sent to the scrapyard as it breaks apart. You salvage what looks usable from its remains before pressing onwards.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_AUTO_FIGHT_DESTROYED_2">The AI of the automated scout remains online for a brief moment after its host ship explodes before shutting down for good, unconscious as its remains are looted.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_AUTO_FIGHT_DESTROYED_3">One more of the masses of automated Rebels is shot down, its corpse scattering useful scrap materials before your recovery arms.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_AUTO_FIGHT_DESTROYED_4">These sentient nuisances just keep on coming; with each one you destroy, there is sure to be many to replace it. You quickly scrap the ship and prepare to jump.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_AUTO_FIGHT_DESTROYED_5">This AI wasn't smart enough to outwit your more natural instincts, its destruction a sign of that discovery. You collect what seems useful from its remains before leaving.</text>
<text name="ce_event_NOTHING_REBEL_c12_e">You quickly drop some mines as you circle around the beacon. The Rebel forces will have to avoid this area, clear the minefield or suffer heavy damage. All possibilities will considerably delay their fleet.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_NOTHING_REBEL_4">There are no other ships near this beacon, however you detect a small communications relay. You tap into it without a problem; there are no encryptions. Most of the chatter revolves around troop and fleet movements, nothing particularly interesting.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_NOTHING_REBEL_5">There is a small planet nearby with scattered settlements. A small Rebel fleet is in orbit with many ships ferrying back and forth. It must be a recently 'liberated' planet.</text>
<text name="ce_event_START_BEACON_REBEL_c4">(Advanced Engines) Override the engines' security protocols and accept the engine degradation that comes with traveling at extremely high speeds. [ Fuel: -4; Hull Damage: 4 ]</text>

<text name="ce_event_START_BEACON_REBEL_ACTUAL_c9_e">The access kit allows you to hack the beacon and disable it completely. You are right under the Rebels' noses but they will never know that you came here. This should give you an advantage for now.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_START_BEACON_REBEL_2">This sector was hit hard by the Rebellion. The many alien settlements and stations located here are now watched over by almost an equal number of Rebel bases, heavy-handedly 'keeping the peace.'</text>
<text name="ce_textList_START_BEACON_REBEL_3">Once the Federation forces were scattered the Rebels came down hard on the locals here. Between the 'tax collectors' and military bases, the Rebel presence in this sector is high.</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_CE_BOUNTY_LIST_REBEL_2">Students on a small planetary settlement are unhappy about being watched by a Rebel surveillance satellite. While some of them have taken up military training, others want to hire outside help, so that no one (other than maybe you) gets hurt. Target: Auto Satellite. Payment: Low.</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_CE_BOUNTY_LIST_REBEL_3">A tiny settlement still loyal to the Federation seeks to recruit a gun for hire. The'll pay you to destroy the automated scouts that guard their system. Target: Automated Craft. Payment: Low.</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_CE_BOUNTY_LIST_REBEL_4">Even though the Rebels have millions of supporters in this sector, not everyone seems to be happy. A wealthy underground group is ready to pay any Captain crazy enough to fight the Rebels right in their core territory. Target: Rebel Cruiser. Payment: High.</text>
<text name="ce_event_AUTO_CIVILIAN_c1_e">Power up your weapons and engage the automated ship.</text>
<text name="ce_event_SQUAT_REFUEL_STATION_c1_e">The Rebel responds to your threat, "I don't know who you are, but no one defies the Rebel fleet!" They move in to engage.</text>
<text name="ce_event_AUTO_REFUEL_STATION">You detect an automated Rebel scout attacking a small refueling outpost. </text>
<text name="ce_event_AUTO_DEFENSE_MAP_c1">Attack the automated ship to get to the sensor station records.</text>

<text name="ce_event_AUTO_DEFENSE_ITEM">An advanced Rebel automated ship remains stationed near a small Rebel space station. Sensors indicate it's a storage vessel for military goods.</text>
<text name="ce_event_AUTO_DEFENSE_RADAR_c3">(Anti-Ship Drone) Send a drone to distract the automated ship.</text>
<text name="ce_event_NEBULA_REBEL_BOARDING">There appears to be a number of small stations nearby. Before you have time to scan them, warnings go off. A Rebel teleporter activates in one of the stations.</text>
<text name="ce_event_NEBULA_REBEL_BOARDING_c1">(Teleporter Disruptor) Activate your disruptor field.</text>
<text name="ce_event_NEBULA_REBEL_BOARDING_c1_e">With the disruptor active the Rebels here can't do anything. They call in reinforcements on all channels but there seem to be no combat ready ships in the system. You charge your FTL with a grin on your face.</text>
<text name="ce_event_NEBULA_REBEL_BOARDING_c2_e"> We've been boarded!</text>
<text name="ce_event_BOARDERS_REBEL_SHIP_c1">(Teleporter Disruptor) There is still time to activate the disruption field.</text>
<text name="ce_event_BOARDERS_REBEL_SHIP_c1_e">You successfully defend yourself against the boarding attempt.</text>
<text name="ce_event_BOARDERS_REBEL_SHIP_c2_e">We've been boarded!</text>
<text name="ce_textList_BOARDERS_REBEL_SHIP_1">You receive a message from the nearby Rebel station's commander, "You have a lot of guts passing through our space, I'll give you that." She tells her men, "Kill their crew, I want that ship intact."</text>
<text name="ce_textList_BOARDERS_REBEL_SHIP_2">Your sensors warn of an incoming Rebel ship at the same time as the well-known computer voice of your ship AI warns you of an active enemy teleporter. You get a taunting message, "Ready to die? I sure am ready to get a promotion!"</text>
<text name="ce_textList_BOARDERS_REBEL_SHIP_3">Incoming message, "Hello, Captain," says a Rebel in an officer's garb. "How very generous of you to turn yourself in. Prepare to be boarded. Come quietly and we may be lenient."</text>
<text name="ce_textList_BOARDERS_REBEL_SHIP_4">You receive a message on a low-band channel. "You're surrounded, just like the last of your Federation friends. Just die already." The enemy has teleported onto our ship!</text>
<text name="ce_textList_BOARDERS_REBEL_SHIP_5">As you arrive, you become aware of a small Rebel outpost near the beacon. You are hardly able to bark an order before you detect a teleporter charging and a ship moving in. They must have been expecting you...</text>
<text name="ce_event_AUTO_HACKER">Your arrival is greeted by numerous computer alerts. The nearby automated Rebel scout has deployed a virus and disrupted your shield system. Hopefully it won't cause further problems before you can destroy it.</text>
<text name="ce_event_AUTO_HACKER_c1_e">You program an attack plan. "Redirect power to other systems!"</text>
<text name="ce_event_AUTO_HACKER_c2">(Effector) Use your own electronic warfare equipment to counter the cyber-attack.</text>
<text name="ce_event_AUTO_HACKER_c2_e">Your effector allows you to access the scout's outer data stores and you eliminate the virus. Power up the shields!</text>
<text name="ce_event_REBEL_TRANSPORT_c2_e">They stay outside your weapons range and eventually jump away.</text>
<text name="ce_event_BROKEN_REBEL_DRONE_c4">(Effector) Use your electronic warfare device to hack into the scout.</text>
<text name="ce_event_BROKEN_REBEL_DRONE_c4_e">Your effector turns the scout's security routines against each other and the scout's computer disables itself. You download its map data into your navigation system and strip the ship of useful materials.</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_DOWNLOAD_DRONE_DATA_2">You accidentally reactivate the ship's AI. Its weapons and shields immediately go online; prepare for a fight!</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_REBEL_TRANSPORT_DESTROYED_2">You search the remains of the ship but only come across blueprints and debris from broken machinery. A shame, but you take what scrap you can salvage.</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_REBEL_TRANSPORT_DESTROYED_5">Searching the remains, you find that the cargo was military-grade drone schematics! You bring them aboard to install in your ship.</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_REBEL_TRANSPORT_DESTROYED_6">The debris implies that the ship was carrying drone schematics, but unfortunately nothing remains. You do find functioning drone parts, however.</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_REBEL_TRANSPORT_DESTROYED_9">You detect faint life signatures from an intact piece of the hull. They were transporting prisoners, and the sole survivor offers to join your crew as a first step on their path to get revenge.</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_REBEL_TRANSPORT_DESTROYED_12">The ship was apparently transporting confiscated goods. Some crates remain undamaged; you load them into your cargo holds.</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_REBEL_TRANSPORT_DESTROYED_13">The ship was apparently transporting materials for deep space construction. The sturdy rods are barely damaged - This must be what the Rebels build their many stations of. You load the cargo into your holds.</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_REBEL_TRANSPORT_DESTROYED_15">The ship was transporting a haul of gems. This would be a more exciting find if these materials would not be abundantly available in outer space. You load the cargo into your holds.</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_REBEL_TRANSPORT_DESTROYED_16">The ship was apparently transporting hyper-flexible cable elements. Some crates remain undamaged; you load them into your cargo holds.</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_REBEL_TRANSPORT_DESTROYED_17">The ship was apparently transporting industrial drones. You have no use for them, but maybe you can find a good buyer for the machines somewhere. You load them into your cargo holds.</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_REBEL_TRANSPORT_CAPTURED_1">This ship was ferrying a bunch of cadets to their first assignments, you find them hiding deep within the ship. The young Rebels have just passed training and seem ill equipped to offer any kind of resistance. They surrender and demand to be treated in accordance with general system law.</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_REBEL_TRANSPORT_CAPTURED_1_c1">Take the Rebels as prisoners.</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_REBEL_TRANSPORT_CAPTURED_1_c2">Execute the Rebels on the spot.</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_REBEL_TRANSPORT_CAPTURED_1_c2_e">You decide that you have neither the time, nor the resources to take care of prisoners. These Rebels will act against the Federation if set free, but when you order them shot your crew refuses to act against unarmed POWs. You grab a pulse rifle and gun down the pleading and screaming Rebels yourself.</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_REBEL_TRANSPORT_CAPTURED_1_c3">(Mantis Ship) Torture the Rebels for Information.</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_REBEL_TRANSPORT_CAPTURED_1_c3_e">You order them to be take to the special room. After a few hours that involve plenty of shouting, medication and hand tools, the group of cadets is reduced to a whimpering pile of half-dismembered bodies. You learned all you can about the Rebels pursuit vectors and hose down the torture chamber,- airlock style.</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_REBEL_TRANSPORT_CAPTURED_4">This ship was apparently carrying information about the surrounding beacons. You download what you can to the ship's map and scrap the rest of the ship.</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_REBEL_TRANSPORT_CAPTURED_5">The ship was apparently transporting confiscated goods. You load them into your cargo holds.</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_CE_QUEST_REBEL_POW_START_4">When bringing the Cadets on board, one of them snatches a rifle from a nearby rack. The young Rebels stage a desperate attempt to take over your ship. You will have to defend yourself.</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_CE_QUEST_REBEL_POW_MEETING_1">It looks like the Rebels do care little about their own. A military vessel waits for you in what is supposed to be the neutral zone and opens fire the moment you arrive.</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_CE_QUEST_REBEL_POW_MEETING_4">You arrive in the neutral zone and meet the Rebel negotiators aboard a small civilian orbital. They agree to pay a ransom in exchange for the lives of the prisoners.</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_CE_QUEST_REBEL_POW_MEETING_7">You arrive in the neutral zone and meet the Rebel negotiators aboard a small civilian orbital. The leverage gained allows you to convince the Rebel officials to delay the pursuing fleet.</text>

<text name="ce_textList_BS_EVENT_AUTO_SUICIDE_TEXT_2">Your ship is hailed: "You have been identified as a high-priority target and are in range of this unit's weapon clusters. Engagement is the logical conclusion." This satellite seems to be controlled by an advanced Rebel combat AI.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_BS_EVENT_AUTO_SUICIDE_TEXT_3">A Rebel defense turret has been stationed here to guard this beacon. You realize that you will have to stay in its weapon range until the FTL drive is charged or it is defeated.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_BS_EVENT_AUTO_SUICIDE_TEXT_4">The AI of a nearby Rebel satellite turret immediately identifies you as a threat and engages.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_BS_EVENT_AUTO_SUICIDE_TEXT_5">A computer generated voice speaks through the comms, "I am one of 5237 identicaly produced Rebel defense turrets. Resistance is futile. Shut down your systems and accept annihilation."</text>

<text name="ce_textList_CE_REBEL_AUTO_CRUISER_TEXT_1">You arrive at what appears to be a garrison for the endless swarms of Rebel auto-ships. Thousands of them lie dormant in space, neatly arranged in parallel lines. While you still consider a bombing run, a guard-cruiser is awakened by your presence. You try to get away but the ship chases you without mercy.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_CE_REBEL_AUTO_CRUISER_TEXT_2">A large Auto-cruiser in sleep mode is found at this beacon. You keep a low energy profile and take great care not to awake the mechanic giant. But suddenly you register in incoming FTL burst message, with Rebel encoding! The Rebels have tracked you here and remotely activate their robotic guardian. Looks like you will have to fight.</text>

<text name="ce_event_BS_EVENT_REBEL_c3_e">The Rebels agree to send an unarmed negotiator. When their shuttle docks, you aren't surprised that four fully suited up Rebel marines exit it instead. They calmly walk up towards you. Suddenly your Mantis crew member bursts out of a nearby cargo crate.</text>
<text name="ce_event_BS_EVENT_REBEL_c3_e_c1_e">With the element of surprise on its side, the Mantis slices the boarders to pieces before they can even reach for their comms. The whole operation gave you enough time to charge the FTL drive and the Rebel station isn't reacting yet. This is your chance to escape!</text>
<text name="ce_textList_BS_EVENT_REBEL_TEXT_1">Your ship is hailed. "Look who we have here! You must be incredibly stupid to come to our doorstep. We'll give you one chance to get out of this alive. Hand over your ship's control to us and surrender."</text>

<text name="ce_textList_BS_EVENT_REBEL_TEXT_3">A Rebel station is guarding this region. As soon as you arrive they message you, "This is the first and only warning, surrender your ship to us or we will open fire with our full weapons array."</text>
<text name="ce_textList_BS_EVENT_REBEL_TEXT_4">A nearby Rebel station puts a high ranking officer on the comm, "Our weapons range is nearly double the jump circle of this beacon. We also outgun you. Be reasonable, you cannot prevail in a fight. Give up, it's over for you."</text>
<text name="ce_textList_BS_EVENT_REBEL_TEXT_5">You receive a transmission: "Sir, you know we cannot let you go. We suggest you surrender to avoid any further violence." The station's weapons target you, but do not fire yet. The Rebels await your response.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_BS_EVENT_REBEL_TEXT_6">A well armed Rebel station obstructs the view of the beacon, it's too late to avoid a fight. They suggest that you surrender.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_BS_EVENT_REBEL_TEXT_7">A Rebel station orbits the nearby planet. An officer is put on the comms, "I was just informed who you are. I can only assume you came here to turn yourself in, right?" The station increases weapon readiness, but isn't firing yet.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_BS_EVENT_REBEL_FAIL_TEXT_1">You surrender and meet the Rebels in your docking bay. They gyro-cuff you and line up the crew behind the chemical shed. You hear shots and are aghast when you realize what is going on here. How did it come to this? You just want to get home... Remote explosives are planted. A highly decorated Rebel officer just stares at you with a look full of spite. They leave and let you wait for the detonation...</text>
<text name="ce_textList_BS_EVENT_REBEL_FAIL_TEXT_2">You retract your weapons, lower the shields and hand over the ship's controls to the Rebel station. The commanding officer is put on the comms, "Interesting, we didn't except this..." ... "Anyway... I'm sorry to bring it to you, but this was a foolish decision." The station fires a full broadside into the mid section of your defenseless ship.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_BS_EVENT_REBEL_FAIL_TEXT_3">You lower your shields and transfer the ship's controls to the Rebels. A small shuttle docks and a marine detachment boards your ship. You hear the muffled sound of pulse-rifles on the lower decks. There is nothing left for you to do but wait for them to enter the bridge. No one comes, instead a sudden explosion that engulfs the whole ship kills you before you can even think about it.</text>
<text name="ce_event_BS_QUEST_REBEL_START">A short while after arriving at the beacon you receive a message with multiple encryption layers from a ship that IDs as Federation. You cannot see it around anywhere. "Greetings, friendlies. This is Federation Infiltrator Solid-PXt005."</text>

<text name="ce_event_BS_QUEST_REBEL_START_c1_e_c1_e">"Good! The target is a Rebel station that is a key part of their supply lines. We transmit coordinates, oh... hostiles incoming, we got to go!" They cease communications and you detect a faint jump signature nearby.</text>
<text name="ce_event_BS_QUEST_REBEL_START_c1_e_c1_e_c1_e">Immediately afterwards a Rebel ship jumps in. "Finally got you, you evasive fu... wait, who are you? A cruiser class? Fed ID, huh? Well just as good." They lock weapons on your ship."</text>
<text name="ce_event_BS_QUEST_REBEL_START_c1_e_c2">"Sorry, but we have our own mission to take care of"</text>
<text name="ce_event_BS_QUEST_REBEL_START_c1_e_c2_e">"Well we wish you luck with that then. You might want to get out of here, we detect incoming bogies." You detect a small jump signature a few klicks away and then a much bigger one right in front of you.</text>
<text name="ce_event_BS_QUEST_REBEL_START_c1_e_c2_e_c1_e">A Rebel ship jumps in and hails, "Hmm, you are not who we are looking for... I see, you are even better!". They get into an attack position.</text>
<text name="ce_event_BS_QUEST_REBEL_FIGHT">You arrive at the coordinates given and find the supply station carefully hidden in a nearby asteroid field. An attack pattern is programmed and you start your assault.</text>
<text name="ce_event_BS_QUEST_REBEL_REWARD">You arrive at the location specified by the Infiltrator. An automated Rebel armory orbits a nearby moon, with a few Rebel riggers currently docking. After transmitting the stolen codes you receive automated docking instructions.</text>
<text name="ce_event_BS_QUEST_REBEL_REWARD_c1_e">You remain tense and ready to power the weapons at a second's notice, but no one bothers you as the station's drones install a weapon from the Rebels' arsenal on your ship. You leave the station immediately and charge the FTL.</text>

The planetary cruise control addresses your ship: "Welcome to planet... oh, uhm... let me talk to my supervisor for a second." Communications are cut and planetary-scale defense guns power up. It seems coming here was not a good idea.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_CE_PDS_REBEL_TEXT_4">Cruising around deep in Rebel space it was only a matter of time until you find a properly defended star system. If you give it some time, the planetary defense artillery will turn your ship into fine stardust.</text>

<text name="ce_eventList_CE_PDS_REBEL_LIST_2">A ship of the local defense squadron is dispatched to spot for the Rebel artillery. You will have to get out of this system quickly to escape the deadly barrage.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_STORE_REBEL_2">You arrive at a small space station that is putting out wide-band broadcasts on black market channels. You doubt they would turn away any business, regardless of allegiance.</text>

<text name="ce_textList_STORE_REBEL_4">A trade hub orbits this Rebel controlled planet. Propaganda is constantly broadcast on multiple channels. No Rebel ships are detected in the system so you decide to search for a grey market trader.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_STORE_REBEL_5">A trade ship sells goods in the orbit of this planet. Security is lacking, they don't even check ship identification here.</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_TE_STORE_REBEL_ACTUAL_1">You consider striking a deal here. This might take some time.</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_TE_STORE_REBEL_ACTUAL_1_c1">Buy some confiscated goods.</text>

<text name="ce_textList_STORE_REBEL_BUY_TEXT_4">To seal the deal you have to give detailed explanations on your trade license and your (fake) ship registration. Everything is double checked. Why is this taking so long? Then, the cargo is finally loaded. Slowly. At last, you get a chance to look at the ship gear they also offer.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_STORE_REBEL_SELL_TEXT_1">Negotiations are interrupted when a Rebel inspector enters the shop. You are lucky that the trader lets you hide in an equipment closet. Later you take your advance. Better deliver the cargo to the shop and get out of here quick.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_STORE_REBEL_SELL_TEXT_2">You have to make stuff up as you go when the trader asks you about your ship and employer. He seems suspicious, but he agrees to pay some scrap in advance. You better unload the cargo at the shop and leave soon.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_STORE_REBEL_SELL_TEXT_3">Rebel marines patrol the corridors, you are nervous and it takes awhile until you find a trustworthy trader. After agreeing on a price you now have to unload the cargo at the shop to receive full payment.</text>

<text name="ce_textList_START_BEACON_AUTO_1">The Rebels swept over this sparely populated region, leaving nothing but a small automated production fleet behind. Since then, the tireless machines have harvested the local resources to build copies of themselves till they eventually gained full control over the entire sector.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_START_BEACON_AUTO_2">You arrived at a remote production base of your enemy. The work here is mostly done by automated mining vessels and AI controlled factory ships. You are unlikely to meet many Rebels on your route, but their mechanical servants will easily identify you as a thread. Be on your guard.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_START_BEACON_AUTO_3">Once this region was conquered, the Rebels stationed a sizable force of their automated ship here. The autonomous machines have then turned the sector into one of the primary production zones of the Rebellion, all by themselves.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_START_BEACON_AUTO_4">A bleak fate has befallen this sector: It has been taken over by an automated Rebel factory fleet - Machines that do nothing but building other machines, which then either fight for the Rebels or build even more machines.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_START_BEACON_AUTO_5">Once a neutral zone, this region is now consumed by an automated Rebel mining fleet. The constructs will only stop once all usable resources of the sector are turned into war assets that serve the Rebellion.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_START_BEACON_AUTO_6">The crew started to wonder where all these Rebel auto-ships come from. Now you know: They were built right here. The machines are in total control of this sector and manage their shipyards autonomously. There is no doubt that they are also instructed to look for you.</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_CE_BOUNTY_LIST_AUTO_6">Even though the Rebels have millions of supporters in this sector, not everyone seems to be happy. A wealthy underground group is ready to pay any Captain mad enough to fight the Rebels right in their core territory. Target: Rebel Cruiser. Payment: Very High.</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_CE_BOUNTY_LIST_AUTO_7">The automated units have shut down the bounty hunter network for this sector. You won't be able to get a contract this time.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_NOTHING_AUTO_1">You enter a system home to another robotic shipyard. Cargo transporters deliver resources and appear tiny in comparison to the massive autonomous factory cruisers. There is no way to know if the ships are aware of your presence, but for the meantime you are completely ignored. Better move on soon.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_NOTHING_AUTO_2">You arrive near a major refueling hub. Large solar panels power the installation and several auto ships are docked to refuel. Your ship is being scanned multiple times, but the auto forces do not react to your presence.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_NOTHING_AUTO_4">There are no other ships near this beacon, however you detect a small communications relay. You try to tap into it; but the auto-chatter is heavily encrypted.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_NOTHING_AUTO_5">There is a small planet nearby with a few scattered settlements. Several automated cruisers are in orbit, deactivated and de-powered. Are they guarding the settlers? You refrain from attempting communication.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_NOTHING_AUTO_6">Countless ship-sized tunnels and mining shafts have been beam-drilled into the crust of this planet. All resources have long since been extracted, the automated miners have moved on.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_NOTHING_AUTO_7">A refugee caravan guarded by Auto-Fabricators is preparing for the long journey to another sector. The humanoids explain that the Rebels are resettling them. They surely must be aware that you are not supposed to be here, but no alarm is raised. You are unsure what to make of this.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_NOTHING_AUTO_8">Weapon fire is detected in the distance. Automated ships in combat formation fire at what must be simulated targets. The ships are put through real-space testing before being shipped out for duty.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_NOTHING_AUTO_9">This factory planet is guarded by auto assault ships, but they let you pass upon transmitting some simple identity codes you picked up in the com network. If the machines where any smarter they could surely deduce that you are not supposed to be here. But the Rebels are known to greatly limit their auto ships processing capabilities. A safeguard against AI revolts.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_CE_FREE_STUFF_AUTO_TEXT_1">You arrive in a system and immediately discover an automated construction unit nearby. Strangely, scans indicate the ship is striped of its AI core. You salvage from the units construction supplies.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_CE_FREE_STUFF_AUTO_TEXT_2">Not much remains in this abandoned system; however, scans reveal an abandoned deep-space construction site nearby. Some supplies have been left behind.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_CE_FREE_STUFF_AUTO_TEXT_3">You happen upon the remains of construction platform. It has been mostly picked clean but there appears to be a few supplies that will aid you in your mission.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_CE_REBEL_CONSTRUCTION_PATROL_TEXT_1">You wonder when you last communicated with a living being that is not part of your crew. Just then, your ship is hailed: "We've found you at last. Prepare to die." Rebels!</text>
<text name="ce_textList_CE_REBEL_CONSTRUCTION_PATROL_TEXT_2">A small Rebel ship is docked at a large shipyard, delivering crew to a newly built cruiser. Their ship is not yet combat ready, but they move in to attack in their militarized transport craft.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_CE_REBEL_CONSTRUCTION_PATROL_TEXT_3">You run into one of the few manned Rebel patrols of the sector.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_CE_REBEL_CONSTRUCTION_PATROL_TEXT_4">What must be a Rebel inspection group is charging FTL at this beacon. Their escort attacks as soon as you arrive to allow the officers to escape.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_CE_REBEL_CONSTRUCTION_PATROL_TEXT_5">Com chatter you receive while jumping in does not bode well: "Yes, the jump signature is a match, I think we found them. Going quiet and engaging now." Soon, the ship appears on your radar, closing in fast.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_CE_REBEL_CONSTRUCTION_PATROL_TEXT_6">A lone Rebel ship hails you: "Greetings! I thought I'd never meet another living being till my turn ends. Let me check your ID and then we can... oh... Ehm, sorry." They cut communication and, after a moment, load weapons.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_CE_REBEL_AUTO_CRUISER_CONSTRUCTION_TEXT_1">You arrive at a completely automated Rebel shipyard. Huge cruisers manufacture smaller Auto-Scouts in open space. One of the behemoths reacts to your arrival by transmitting a deep, synthetic growl. The ship moves in to attack.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_CE_REBEL_AUTO_CRUISER_CONSTRUCTION_TEXT_2">An automated cruiser constructs a Rebel outpost in the orbit of this planet. Eliminating you seems to take priority over its current duty. The massive ship detaches from the half finished structure and transmits a crude hail: "Federation Captain. Do not attempt to resist this unit. You will be captured and receive a fair trial." You seriously doubt that.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_CE_REBEL_AUTO_CRUISER_CONSTRUCTION_TEXT_3">You arrive to discover a Rebel cruiser performing maintenance on this beacon. The ship ignores you at first, but soon you receive the usual hail, saying: "This is an automated message. Resisting our takeover is pointless. Prepare to die."</text>
<text name="ce_textList_CE_REBEL_AUTO_CONSTRUCTION_TEXT_1">You discover a lone auto construction ship, heading to execute whatever its current task is. The ship's primitive AI can't make sense of your presence here and decides to stage a makeshift attack.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_CE_REBEL_AUTO_CONSTRUCTION_TEXT_2">You jumped right into the flight path of a Rebel construction craft. The machine continues on its trajectory unimpressed and starts blasting you with its industrial-grade weaponry.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_CE_REBEL_AUTO_CONSTRUCTION_TEXT_3">An automated ship is mining a comet that is passing through this system. The auto craft is armed; its simple subroutines force it to attack any non-Rebel crafts in the region.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_CE_REBEL_AUTO_CONSTRUCTION_TEXT_4">Your ship receives a hail in text form: "This is an automated message. Construction units in this sector are programmed to engage any non-Rebel crafts they encounter. Leave or be eradicated."</text>
<text name="ce_textList_CE_REBEL_AUTO_CONSTRUCTION_TEXT_5">The AI of a nearby Rebel construction vessel is unsure how to react to your presence. First it sends contradicting messages, then it continuously scans you, till it finally activates its defense weapons.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_CE_REBEL_AUTO_CONSTRUCTION_TEXT_6">Another unmanned constructor roams this area. You prepare the ship for combat.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_CE_REBEL_AUTO_CONSTRUCTION_TEXT_7">This beacon is currently being checked for damage by an unmanned engineering unit. The ship is armed and reacts aggressive to your scans.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_CE_REBEL_AUTO_CONSTRUCTION_TEXT_8">A nearby factory is just about to release a newly constructed auto ship into open space. Engaging you must be the first task the ship has ever received in its electronic life.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_DESTROYED_SHIP_AUTO_CONSTRUCTION_STUFF_TEXT_1">The automated constructor suffered damage it won't recover from anymore. You salvage what usable tools and supplies you find among its remains before pressing onwards.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_DESTROYED_SHIP_AUTO_CONSTRUCTION_STUFF_TEXT_2">One more auto-engineer is blown apart and you proceed to loot its remains for construction supplies.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_DESTROYED_SHIP_AUTO_CONSTRUCTION_STUFF_TEXT_3">Rebel construction crafts are no less dangerous than their scouting counterparts. But at last this one won't stand in your way any more. You quickly search its tool compartments for supplies and prepare to move on.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_DESTROYED_SHIP_AUTO_CONSTRUCTION_TEXT_1">One more Rebel construction unit is destroyed. In death it emits an short range burst message. An autonomous shipyard at the other end of the system comes online, undoubtedly already manufacturing a replacement. These battles start to seems really pointless.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_DESTROYED_SHIP_AUTO_CONSTRUCTION_TEXT_3">You try to tell yourself that you are deeply disrupting Rebel ship production here, but there is no denying the the truth: you won't stop these machines. For every ship destroyed, two more might already be put together in a nearby assembly line.</text>
<text name="ce_event_CE_REBEL_AUTO_CONSTRUCTION_SUN">You arrive to find yourself very close to this systems sun. The beacon belongs to a power station still in the process of being build. An automated unit is installing shielded solar panels and immediately gets into an attack vector to defend its construction project.</text>
<text name="ce_event_CE_REBEL_AUTO_CONSTRUCTION_ASTEROID">You arrive in a mostly depleted asteroid belt. A Rebel construction unit is busy dissembling an old mining base, but then detaches and moves towards you. Attacking you seems to rank high on the constructors priority list.</text>
<text name="ce_event_CE_CONSTRUCTION_SPACE_FACTORY">Proximity warnings light up all over the screen. Beacon data explains that you find yourself inside a zero-grav factory of colossal proportions. The installation even has direct jump access. Countless tunnels lead to the various parts of the factory, but none are designed for ships of your size.</text>
<text name="ce_event_CE_CONSTRUCTION_SPACE_FACTORY_c1_e">When you attempt a detailed scan of your surroundings, the first thing you notice is a nearby bulkhead opening. A hard-mounted turret slides out of the wall and turns towards you. "Intrusion detected. You have three seconds to verify your identity. 3... 2..."</text>
<text name="ce_event_CE_CONSTRUCTION_SPACE_FACTORY_c1_e_c1_e">"... 1... Verification failed. Engaging target." The turret starts to unload it's weapon clusters on you. Your augment allows you to use the side thrusters to their full potential. You can navigate more safely within the confined environment of the hangar.</text>
<text name="ce_event_CE_CONSTRUCTION_SPACE_FACTORY_c1_e_c2_e">"... 1... Verification failed. Engaging target." The turret starts to unload it's weapon clusters on you. There is no space to navigate here; you are a sitting duck.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_BS_EVENT_AUTO_CONSTRUCTION_TEXT_1">You discover a Rebel construction satellite in the process of building an exact copy of itself. The stations AI abandons its current task in favor of attacking you.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_BS_EVENT_AUTO_CONSTRUCTION_TEXT_2">Your ship is hailed, "You have been identified as a high priority target and are in range of this unit's weapon clusters. Engagement is the logical conclusion." This construction satellite seems to be well able to defend itself.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_BS_EVENT_AUTO_CONSTRUCTION_TEXT_3">A Rebel production satellite has been placed at this beacon. You realize that you will have to stay in its weapon range until the FTL drive is charged or it is defeated.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_BS_EVENT_AUTO_CONSTRUCTION_TEXT_4">The simple AI of a nearby Rebel maintenance satellite manages to identify you as a threat and engages.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_BS_EVENT_AUTO_CONSTRUCTION_TEXT_5">A text pops up on the screen: "This is an automated message. Construction units in this sector are programmed to engage any non-Rebel crafts they encounter. Leave or be eradicated." The message originates from a small unmanned shipyard nearby. Its defense guns power up!</text>
<text name="ce_textList_BS_EVENT_AUTO_CONSTRUCTION_TEXT_6">Another unmanned construction platform is stationed in this area. It is busy assembling auto-scout engines. You swoop in for an attack run before the unit can even decide how to react to your arrival.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_BS_EVENT_AUTO_CONSTRUCTION_TEXT_7">As you jump in, a Rebel construction satellite activates its defense guns. A fight seems unavoidable.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_BS_EVENT_AUTO_CONSTRUCTION_TEXT_8">You receive a hail from a small AI run satellite, "This is an automated message. My data indicates that you are not supposed to be here, I'm forced to engage you."</text>
<text name="ce_textList_BS_EVENT_AUTO_CONSTRUCTION_TEXT_9">Scans show huge orbital factories all around this planet. Even on the surface, most work is done by automated constructs. It is your luck that the Rebels seem to care little about security here; the only thing capable of defending the beacon perimeter is an industrial grade satellite.</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_BS_STATION_AUTO_CONSTRUCTION_DESTROYED_1">The engineering station ceases functioning. You move in closer to salvage what remains of its construction supplies.</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_BS_STATION_AUTO_CONSTRUCTION_DESTROYED_2">The engineering station ceases functioning. You move in closer to loot its remains and the construction supplies it was guarding.</text>

<text name="ce_eventList_BA_SCRAPYARD_EXPLORE_RESULTS_1">After a brief exploration you only found little of use.</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_BA_SCRAPYARD_EXPLORE_RESULTS_2">You discover a derelict ship weapon. Your engineers manage to get it back into working condition.</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_BA_SCRAPYARD_EXPLORE_RESULTS_3">You search through an area of the field apparently reserved for scrapped drones and salvage a few parts.</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_BA_SCRAPYARD_EXPLORE_RESULTS_4">As you scan an old FTL drive for usable fuel this unexpectedly sets of a chain reaction. The reactor detonates.</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_BA_SCRAPYARD_EXPLORE_RESULTS_4_c1">(Advanced Navigation AI) Brace for impact! Activate AI controlled evasion!</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_BA_SCRAPYARD_EXPLORE_RESULTS_4_c1_e">Within seconds, the navigation AI brings your ship into the optimal position to withstand the explosion. Your shields are depleted completely, but the hull takes no damage.</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_BA_SCRAPYARD_EXPLORE_RESULTS_4_c2_e">You can't manage to pull the ship away fast enough. Drive plasma sweeps over the ship and damages the hull. Even worse, the Engi scrap-wardens ask you to leave "before you cause any more trouble".</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_BA_SCRAPYARD_EXPLORE_RESULTS_5">At the edge of the scrapyard a pirate ship suddenly emerges from the husk of an derelict supply station! The scavengers immediately fire a pre-ignited salvo and your evasive maneuver forces you into the nearby asteroid belt.</text>
<text name="ce_event_NEBULA_ENGI_AUTO_c1_e_c2">(Advanced Cloaking Field) Shut down all redundant systems go into full stealth mode.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_NEBULA_ENGI_AUTO_TEXT_1">Somewhat expected, the Rebels have already sent automated ships into the ice field to look for you. There is no hiding here.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_NEBULA_ENGI_AUTO_TEXT_2">You jump into an isolated region far away from any stars or other sources of radiation. There is almost no background radiation to conceal ship signatures, you already pick up the auto scout that is heading for your position when it is still several klicks away. It still looks like you won't get away before it arrives.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_NEBULA_ENGI_AUTO_TEXT_3">Massive chunks of frozen nebula gas slowly rotate around this beacon. A hazard tag informs you that some Engi experiment has gone horrible wrong here and has made the entire system uninhabitable. Suddenly, you see lights between the galactic glaciers. A previously dormant rebel scout bursts out of the ice, its red status lights glowing aggressively!</text>
<text name="ce_textList_NEBULA_ENGI_AUTO_TEXT_4">A Rebel drone, completely frozen, drifts near this beacon. This doesnt's seem right; The ship should be hardly affected by the low temperature... "It's just in sleep mode, Captain. There, systems coming online!" The icy cocoon shatters as the scout's weapon pods swing into firing position.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_BS_EVENT_NEBULA_ENGI_AUTO_SUICIDE_TEXT_1">The Rebels must have anticipated you would try to lose them within the ice field; an automated defense turret was waiting for you at the beacon.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_BS_EVENT_NEBULA_ENGI_AUTO_SUICIDE_TEXT_2">You jumped off the mark a bit, but the Rebel turret that guards the beacon spots you even from several klicks away. No wonder: This area is distant from active stars and no background radiation interferes with sensors.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_BS_EVENT_NEBULA_ENGI_AUTO_SUICIDE_TEXT_3">A few seconds after you arrive, weapon fire shatters the ice around your ship. A Rebel satellite is surveying this part of the field!</text>
<text name="ce_textList_BS_EVENT_NEBULA_ENGI_AUTO_SUICIDE_TEXT_4">It seems forward units of the Rebels already scouted the ice field and left some guard ships behind. It's what you would have done as well.</text>
<text name="ce_event_NEBULA_ENGI_PIRATE_c1_e">"Affirmative. Transmitting supplies."</text>
<text name="ce_event_NEBULA_ENGI_PIRATE_c2_e">The pirate ship turns and faces your attack. They know that there is no way to hide here.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_NEBULA_ENGI_PIRATE_TEXT_1">The collective nature of the Engi beings usually prevents any deviations from social norms. That's why Engi pirates are a rare sight. The rogue robots offer some supplies if you keep quiet about their whereabouts.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_NEBULA_ENGI_PIRATE_TEXT_2">An Engi ship with pirate markings tries to hide within this ice field, but there is so little sensor interference that you pick it up with ease. Your receive a message "For [undefined] no return possible. Collective: Flawed. Materials in exchange for cooperation acceptable?"</text>
<text name="ce_textList_NEBULA_ENGI_PIRATE_TEXT_3">A Engi military craft is docked at a small supply depot. They are busy painting pirate markings on their ship. You are hailed, "This operation: clandestine/legalized. Degree 5 cooperation required." The Engi offer supplies if you look the other way.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_NEBULA_ENGI_NOTHING_TEXT_1">You arrived in an area far away from any stars that could make planets inhabitable. The space faring Engi depend little on permanent planetary installations and often settle near such desolate regions.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_NEBULA_ENGI_NOTHING_TEXT_2">A thick layer of ice covers this beacon. Shards the size of small planets float quietly around you. According to the ship computer, the field will gather more mass and collapse into a new star within a few billion standard years.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_NEBULA_ENGI_NOTHING_TEXT_3">Huge ice asteroids dot this system, too far away from any major stars to be melted within your lifetime. A thick layer of frozen matter soon covers your ship hull. The radiation from your ship must be detectable hundreds of klicks away, but there is no one around to do so.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_NEBULA_ENGI_NOTHING_TEXT_4">The interference-free ice field allows you to get a clear reading of the entire system. There is no one here. This heatless region of space seems completely frozen and deserted.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_BS_EVENT_ENGI_TEXT_1">A small Engi station is looping a warning message, "Warning! Quarantine Level 7 in effect under FHA Act 283, article 4.7. Station's personal infected with terminal personality degradation virus. Keep your distance." This virus is known to destroy the self-consciousness of individual Engi, resulting in unpredictable, aggressive behavior.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_BS_EVENT_ENGI_TEXT_2">You spot a small Engi ring-station at this beacon. They message you, "Our designation: science lab RPG-74-PXTCC. Purpose: Running war simulations. Elapsed time since program start: 108 standard years. Engi station's evaluated disposition: Eccentric aggressive. Exchange of fire to be expected. Valuable Data will be collected."</text>
<text name="ce_textList_BS_EVENT_ENGI_TEXT_3">Immediately after arriving in the system your vidscreen shows a small Engi ship. They are fired on by one of their own stations and message, "Danger present. Fellow Engi infected with personality degradation virus. Station purging necessary. Success wished for you by this Engi." They jump away and leave you with a station full of mad Engi, which now starts targeting you.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_BS_DISTRESS_ENGI_MEDICAL_MANTIS_CONTROLLED_TEXT_1">The distress signal originates from a small Engi station under attack by a Mantis troopship. The transporter is badly damaged and jumps away as soon as it registers your arrival. Unfortunately the Mantis seem to have completed their boarding operation. The station starts firing at you, hinting that they are already in control of the weapon systems!</text>
<text name="ce_textList_BS_DISTRESS_ENGI_MEDICAL_MANTIS_CONTROLLED_TEXT_2">Your scans show a small Engi halo at this beacon, but as you hail them, a Mantis appears on the vidscreen, in the process of impaling a still moving Engi on its claws. The aliens stare at you for a few seconds in surprise and no one says a word. Then the Mantis cut communication and load weapons. Looks like you have interrupted one of their boarding parties at work here.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_BS_DISTRESS_ENGI_MEDICAL_MANTIS_CONTROLLED_TEXT_3">It seems you arrived too late to help the Engi in distress, after jump completion the distress signal has already been shut off and the scanners show a small Mantis ship detaching from an Engi station. They must have taken it over because it immediately starts firing at you!</text>
<text name="ce_textList_BS_DISTRESS_ENGI_MEDICAL_MANTIS_CONTROLLED_TEXT_4">Arriving at the beacon you come under fire from the station that sends the distress call. An encoded burst message from deep within the structure explains things: "Danger present. Installation security breached. Mantis invaders on board. This Engi retreated to station's saferoom blue-A. Assistance requested, but destruction of this station and this Engi is not preferred."</text>
<text name="ce_textList_BS_DISTRESS_ENGI_MEDICAL_MANTIS_CONTROLLED_TEXT_5">As you drop to impulse speed your scanners register multiple escape pods and shuttles which are shot down one by one by the station they apparently originate from. One shuttle hails, "Help requested. Mantis boarders acquired control of this installation. Assistance possible? Reward for leaving station intact: average to substantial."</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_BS_DISTRESS_ENGI_MEDICAL_MANTIS_CONTROLLED_SAVE_1">All of the escape pods have been shot down, and no Engi remains active on the station. Your crew agrees with stripping it for the good of the mission.</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_BS_DISTRESS_ENGI_MEDICAL_MANTIS_CONTROLLED_SAVE_2">A few shuttles got away in time. They agree to share their fuel supply with you to reward you for your actions.</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_BS_DISTRESS_ENGI_MEDICAL_MANTIS_CONTROLLED_SAVE_3">Only one escape pod indicates that its passenger is still alive. The surviving Engi communicates that they would rather join your crew instead of returning alone to their station. They leave a message for the Engi Logic Authority and authorize you to take some less important equipment with you as a reward.</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_BS_DISTRESS_ENGI_MEDICAL_MANTIS_CONTROLLED_SAVE_4">After you verify your identity an Engi emerges from a saferoom within the station. "Gratitude: substantial. Destruction without rendered assistance: more than likely. Request supplies."</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_BS_DISTRESS_ENGI_MEDICAL_MANTIS_CONTROLLED_SAVE_4_c4">(Engi Crew) Threat continuous. Importance of re-establishing Federation control imperative. See attached command protocol 52.34.</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_BS_DISTRESS_ENGI_MEDICAL_MANTIS_CONTROLLED_SAVE_4_c4_e">They agree. "Positive. Hull repair and ordinance transfer possible. Federation base coordinates attached if further assistance is required."</text>
<text name="ce_textList_CE_EVENT_ENGI_COLLECTOR_TEXT_1">While generally a peaceful species, some Engi are so fascinated by organic beings that they engage in activities that most other species would call morally questionable. You stumble upon one of their infamous body collectors and they don't seem to care that your crew is still alive.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_CE_EVENT_ENGI_COLLECTOR_TEXT_2">An Engi body snatcher looms at this beacon. They hail, "This message: friendly greeting attempt. Logic suggest: Needs of many outweigh needs of few. Subject agrees with live body dissection? Medical knowledge acquired by cooperation: Substantial" As you don't answer to this ghastly proposal they take this as a yes and charge weapons.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_CE_EVENT_ENGI_COLLECTOR_TEXT_3">After jump completion you soon register a small scout that looks even more in disarray than usual Engi ships. Its rusted hull is adorned with space whale flesh. The commander of this vessel must surely be mad, he confirms this by engaging your ship for no apparent reason.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_CE_EVENT_ENGI_AI_TEXT_1">An advanced science ship of the Engi hails, you are surprised when a combat Avatar appears on the vidscreen, "Greetings human. We have calculated that the Rebel fleet is a level 50 (unstoppable) on the hegemonic threat-scale. Handing you over is the only way to save our masters." Their weapons activate!</text>
<text name="ce_textList_CE_EVENT_ENGI_AI_TEXT_2">This advanced AI ship is no longer under control of the Engi. The Rebels might have hacked the crew, sometimes the combat avatars also turn traitor by themselves. Employing AIs is a risky business and unfortunately it is you who will have to bear the consequences here.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_CE_EVENT_ENGI_AI_TEXT_3">"Captain, we have an AI controlled Engi ship on the scanners, closing in fast." The Engi have automated parts of their fleet during the Rebellion. Many of the combat AIs have been hacked by the Rebels and turned against their former masters.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_C_EVENT_ENGI_TRANSPORT_TEXT_3">A lightly armed Engi transport ship jumps in shortly after you. They refuse all hails, so you just quietly recharge your FTLs while watching each other.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_C_EVENT_ENGI_TRANSPORT_TEXT_4">An Engi transport hails, "This Engi's threat level: insignificant. Federation affinity positive? Relief exercised by this Engi." After a little chit chat they prepare to jump.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_C_EVENT_ENGI_TRANSPORT_TEXT_5">A civilian Engi ship recharges its FTL at this beacon. They hail you, "Caution advisable. Piracy event growth in this sector during last standard year: 187.34 percent. Arrival of "Luck" concept to you hoped for by this Engi."</text>
<text name="ce_textList_C_ENGI_SURRENDER_TEXT_1">The Engi ship surrenders and sends a message, "Destruction of this Engi probable. "Death" concept of other species applicable. Emotional reaction present? Exchange of goods negotiable."</text>
<text name="ce_textList_C_ENGI_SURRENDER_TEXT_2">They send surrender signals and hail, "Efficiency-rating of your piracy attempt: 8. Transfer of goods logical consequence."</text>
<text name="ce_textList_C_ENGI_SURRENDER_TEXT_3">The ship shows heavy damage and the Engi want to surrender.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_C_ENGI_SURRENDER_TEXT_4">You don't really understand their message but you think the Engi want to surrender and offer some supplies if you let them go.</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_C_PIRACY_SUCCESS_LOOT_ENGI_1">They transmit the supplies. It took some time to transfer the goods; their FTL is already charged and they immediately prepare to jump away. A wise decision, you won't be able to attack them again.</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_C_PIRACY_SUCCESS_LOOT_ENGI_5">They hand over their cargo. You are a successful space pirate now. It took some time to transfer the goods; their FTL is already charged and they immediately prepare to jump away. A wise decision, you won't be able to attack them again.</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_C_PIRACY_SUCCESS_LOOT_ENGI_7">They were carrying electronic equipment supplies and agree to give up their cargo. This makes you just another space pirate, but your ship doesn't even have those fancy markings. The opponent's FTL is already charged and they immediately prepare to jump away. A wise decision, you won't be able to attack them again.</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_C_PIRACY_SUCCESS_LOOT_ENGI_8">They where carrying medicine and agree to give up their cargo.

A wise decision, you won't be able to attack them again.</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_C_PIRACY_SUCCESS_LOOT_ENGI_15">They were carrying air filters and agree to give up their cargo.

A wise decision, you won't be able to attack them again.</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_C_PIRACY_SUCCESS_LOOT_ENGI_16">They where carrying industrial drones and agree to give up their cargo.

<text name="ce_eventList_C_PIRACY_SUCCESS_LOOT_ENGI_21">They where carrying solar panels. Your opponent's FTL is already charged when the cargo transfer finishes and they immediately prepare to jump away. A wise decision, you won't be able to attack them again.</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_C_PIRACY_SUCCESS_LOOT_ENGI_22">They where carrying enough clone data to breed a small army. What do the Engi want with that stuff? Your opponent's FTL is already charged when the cargo transfer finishes and they immediately prepare to jump away. A wise decision, you won't be able to attack them again.</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_DEAD_CREW_PIRACY_ENGI_1">There are no more life signs remaining on the civilian vessel. You murdered these poor beings and this constitutes an act of piracy. Your crew might be disturbed.</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_DEAD_CREW_PIRACY_ENGI_1_c2">(Rock Ship) You command a vessel of the brutal Rock people. Your crew knew that they were signing on for a joyride here.</text>

<text name="ce_eventList_DEAD_CREW_PIRACY_ENGI_1_c4">(Slug Ship) You command a vessel of the sly and treacherous Slugs. Your crew knew this mission wouldn't go that cleanly.</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_DEAD_CREW_PIRACY_ENGI_RESULTS_3">A heated discussion among your crew, concerning your moral integrity, leads to one of your crewman pulling a blaster on you. You draw faster and your crew member slumps dead to the cold metal floor. No one on the bridge says a word, everyone just returns to their stations. You go to your quarters and wonder how it has come to this.</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_DEAD_CREW_PIRACY_ENGI_RESULTS_3_clone">It probably would not be wise to revive such a rebellious person. One of your other crewmens watches silently from the doorway as you wipe the traitors mind-backup.</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_DEAD_CREW_PIRACY_ENGI_RESULTS_4">You strip the ship of useful materials. Several crew members file formal complaints on how you handled this. Do you feel guilty?</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_DEAD_CREW_PIRACY_ENGI_RESULTS_5">So many individuals died by your hand during your mission, so the death of these civilians doesn't matter, right? The crew seems to think otherwise. You are able to take the fuel out of the ship's storage. You also take all the scrap you can manage.</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_DEAD_CREW_PIRACY_ENGI_RESULTS_6">You keep telling yourself this was necessary for the mission, but can't help but feel guilty. The looks your crew gives you don't help either. You are able to take the fuel out of the ship's storage. You also take all the scrap you can manage and request a report on the ship's cargo.</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_DEAD_CREW_PIRACY_ENGI_RESULTS_7">There are no more life signs remaining on the ship and you send in a salvage team. One of your crew members sends a formal complaint over the comms, arguing that this operation was unnecessary and against Federation protocols. They decide to desert you mission and stay on board the civilian ship.</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_DEAD_CREW_PIRACY_ENGI_RESULTS_8">Your crew is much more silent during the salvage operation than usual, no one talks to you anymore unless given orders. They find a drone schematic on the ship. With all the civilians slaughtered, you can take it for your ship.</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_DEAD_CREW_PIRACY_ENGI_RESULTS_RISKLESS_6">Your crew doesn't care more than you about these civilians. They throw the bodies out of the airlock and later find a weapons system on the ship. With all the civilians slaughtered, you can take it for your ship.</text>

<text name="ce_eventList_TE_LOOT_GOODS_ENGI_11">The ship's cargo consists of... deep friezed organs?!? You make off with the ghastly goods.</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_TE_LOOT_GOODS_ENGI_13">The ship's cargo consists of a rare whale ambra. The crew must have been illegally hunting space whales. You prepare to take the barrels on board.</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_TE_LOOT_GOODS_ENGI_17">The ship's cargo consisted mainly of air filters parts. Your crew loads the shipment into the cargo holds.</text>

<text name="ce_textList_DISTRESS_QUARANTINE_REFUGEES_TEXT_1">The distress call originates from this densely populated planet. The infection is ravaging its cities and public order has broken down. Everyone wants to get off-world; the stations in orbit are full of people hoping to hitch a ride.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_DISTRESS_QUARANTINE_REFUGEES_TEXT_2">News of the disease has reached this small settlement and panic has broken out. A space dock inquires if you are free to ferry some people away from here.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_DISTRESS_QUARANTINE_REFUGEES_TEXT_3">The distress call comes from a civilian transport which is performing emergency repairs at this beacon. They say that pirates took advantage of their miserable situation and attacked their refugee caravan, which jumped away and left the one damaged ship behind. They are stuck here.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_DISTRESS_QUARANTINE_REFUGEES_TEXT_4">The distress call comes from a major orbital settlement near the third planet of this system. They have taken too many people on board and their life support will soon be unable to produce enough oxygen for everyone.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_DISTRESS_QUARANTINE_REFUGEES_TEXT_5">Several settlements in this sector emit separate distress signals. Rumors of infection have spread in this system, and people hope someone will come to evacuate them.</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_DISTRESS_QUARANTINE_REFUGEES_RESULTS_1">Your offer is first answered by a group of wealthy individuals. They offer some scrap under the condition that you transport them exclusively and take nobody else on board. The fear of infection has made everyone suspicious. You agree to the deal.</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_DISTRESS_QUARANTINE_REFUGEES_RESULTS_2">You dock and soon your main hold is flooded with refugees. The ship has already reached its maximum holding capacity, so you take off quickly. A representative of your passengers is sent to thank you personally. She also hands over a small amount of scrap that was collected to compensate you.</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_DISTRESS_QUARANTINE_REFUGEES_RESULTS_3">The refugees enter the ship in orderly fashion. A young civilian claims to actually be a Federation recruit and offers to join your crew in exchange for a ride out of the sector. This story is a pretty bold lie, but you could always use more crew.</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_DISTRESS_QUARANTINE_REFUGEES_RESULTS_3_c1">Welcome on board!</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_DISTRESS_QUARANTINE_REFUGEES_RESULTS_3_c2">(Improved Medbay) Perform a full medical scan before allowing the person to join.</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_DISTRESS_QUARANTINE_REFUGEES_RESULTS_4">A few hundred people hope to get aboard your ship. You send the crew to keep them in line. Just when you are about to detach, a few armed individuals slip through the airlock, screaming: "Drop your weapons; we're taking over this ship. You will turn around and transport more people!" You can't let this endanger your mission.</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_DISTRESS_QUARANTINE_REFUGEES_RESULTS_5">When you open the bay doors you immediately realize that there are too many refugees to transport. While you still contemplate how many people you can take, screams are heard aboard. Several individuals storm the ship. You are not sure if they are just desperate or already crazed by the disease.</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_DISTRESS_QUARANTINE_REFUGEES_RESULTS_6">By the time you dock, the distress signal has been shut off. You try to hail, but the only answer you get is a hollow banging on the bay doors. Horror awaits when you open them; crazed civilians rush into your ship, swarming the security officer you had standing by near the hold. This crewman will join them in their frenzy.</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_DISTRESS_QUARANTINE_REFUGEES_RESULTS_7">A human medic offers to submit to your command and coordinate the evacuation. They scan the pupils of every passenger with a handheld device. All seem healthy, but then the scanner beeps at one of the refugees.</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_DISTRESS_QUARANTINE_REFUGEES_RESULTS_7_c1_e">The person agrees to leave the ship, but suddenly starts to scream and jumps at one of your crew members, clawing at his face. "Captain, we should leave." The doctor draws a blaster. "Your crewman is beyond saving." You order the bay doors closed. The crewman rises in a frenzy.</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_DISTRESS_QUARANTINE_REFUGEES_RESULTS_8">All hell breaks loose when the bay doors open. A team of humans runs for the ship. "We are Federation medical officers and advise you to get this ship out of here immediately; they are coming! Everyone but us is infected here!" The crew fails to hold off the infected until the ship detaches. Some of the crazed beings enter the ship and several of your original crewmen are bitten.</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_DISTRESS_QUARANTINE_REFUGEES_RESULTS_8_c1_e">Your crewmen have turned into enraged forces of destruction and more infected flood into your ship.</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_DISTRESS_QUARANTINE_REFUGEES_RESULTS_8_c1_e_c1_e">One after one, the med officers establish com connection with you and ask for orders on how to secure the ship. They seem to have experience fighting the infected and could surely be of help.</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_DISTRESS_QUARANTINE_REFUGEES_RESULTS_8_c1_e_c1_e_c1_e">"This is all of us. Your former crewmen are beyond saving and the ship has been compromised. You have to act now. Orders, Captain?" You prepare to retake your ship.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_DISTRESS_QUARANTINE_CREWMEN_TEXT_1">A civilian ship lingers at this beacon and hails, "Wow, not many cruisers left in this sector. I sure would like to get out of here too. Could I hitch a ride in exchange for serving on board? Don't worry, I'm perfectly healthy."</text>
<text name="ce_textList_DISTRESS_QUARANTINE_CREWMEN_TEXT_2">A disabled Federation craft drifts near this beacon. "Hello? Federation craft, do you read me? We've been ambushed by the Rebels; I'm the only one left here. Life support is failing, may I come aboard, Sir?"</text>
<text name="ce_textList_DISTRESS_QUARANTINE_CREWMEN_TEXT_3">The distress call comes from a small station, only manned by a skeleton crew. One of their team contacts your ship on a private channel. "Eh, sorry, I'm not really in distress, but I hoped to sign up on a ship to get out of this forsaken sector."</text>
<text name="ce_textList_DISTRESS_QUARANTINE_CREWMEN_TEXT_4">The distress signal originates from the beacon itself. A lone Captain has teleported onto the structure shortly before his craft was destroyed by the quarantine fleet. "Can I hitch a ride with you?"</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_DISTRESS_QUARANTINE_CREWMEN_RESULTS_1">Health scans aboard the ship indicate the person is clean. Your new crew member seems as relieved as you. "Ready for duty, Captain."</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_DISTRESS_QUARANTINE_CREWMEN_RESULTS_2">The crewman shows you verification documents that show his recent infection scans to be negative. You hope this person will prove reliable.</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_DISTRESS_QUARANTINE_CREWMEN_RESULTS_3">You can't really be sure that this recruit is not infected, but for now they seem to be all right.</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_DISTRESS_QUARANTINE_CREWMEN_RESULTS_4">You hope this person will not get you in trouble.</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_DISTRESS_QUARANTINE_CREWMEN_RESULTS_5">When the new addition to your crew comes aboard everything seems fine, but then, the person collapses at his newly designated station and you order them put under medical supervision. They suddenly turn violent and escape into the corridors of the ship.</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_DISTRESS_QUARANTINE_CREWMEN_RESULTS_6">You soon realize that this person is not as healthy as they might think. The recruit boards your ship with bloodshot eyes, immediately dropping to the floor at the cargo bay ramp. You order them taken to the medbay, but they rise in a violent frenzy, biting the nearest crew member and spreading the strange disease further.</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_DISTRESS_QUARANTINE_CREWMEN_RESULTS_7">The new crewman gets on board your ship, suddenly looking quite pale. "I'm OK, Sir, I promise. Just... let's get out of here?" The crewman does not seem okay at all. You order a full medical check, but the individual turns violent on the way to the medbay. This person is infected!</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_DISTRESS_QUARANTINE_CREWMEN_RESULTS_8">The new crewman gets on board your ship, suddenly looking much worse. "I'm OK, Sir, I promise. Just..." A strong spasm makes the recruit vomit a swell of grey goo on the nearest crew member standing by. They both drop to the floor, shaken by cramps, only to rise seconds late in a frenzied state.</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_QUARANTINE_CREWMEN_RESULTS_SAFE_1">Your advanced medical suite allows you to remotely scan the person for any sign of the disease. The results are negative. Your new crew member seems as relieved as you.</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_QUARANTINE_CREWMEN_RESULTS_SAFE_2">After you get the scan results the potential crew member gives you a hopeful look. You don't really know what to say. In the end you advise that it might still be possible to get help from the quarantine forces. The person does not believe you. You prepare to move on.</text>

<text name="ce_textList_DISTRESS_QUARANTINE_BOARDERS_TEXT_1">Several cities on this planet, as well as some of its orbitals, emit a distress signal. A quarantine fleet is in orbit, teleporting nano med bombs to the surface and shooting down vessels that try to escape. One of the space habitats starts targeting your ship with a teleporter.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_DISTRESS_QUARANTINE_BOARDERS_TEXT_2">Panic has broken out on an orbital habitat at the far side of this system. The station commander who activated the distress signal hails you, but the station's inhabitants are already trying to teleport aboard your ship without your consent.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_DISTRESS_QUARANTINE_BOARDERS_TEXT_3">You are not sure what is going on here. Several individuals try to teleport aboard from a heavily damaged civilian ship nearby. Was the distress signal a trap?</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_DISTRESS_QUARANTINE_BOARDERS_RESULTS_1">The civilians immediately surrender after beaming on board. Some of them drop makeshift melee weapons; many have bloodstains on their clothes. "We are sorry to intrude Captain, but we had to get out if this place. Our transport waits just one jump ahead." One of the group shyly inquires if you need another crewman.</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_DISTRESS_QUARANTINE_BOARDERS_RESULTS_2">A group of civilians beams aboard. "Don't shoot, we are not infected! Please, we will cooperate, and we can pay any price. Just get us to the next beacon." The amount they can pay is actually meager, but it's better than nothing.</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_DISTRESS_QUARANTINE_BOARDERS_RESULTS_3">The civilians immediately surrender after beaming on board. Some of them drop makeshift melee weapons; many have bloodstains on their clothes. You put them under guard and soon one of the group turns and attacks the others, then they all go berserk. It seems they could not escape the virus after all.</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_DISTRESS_QUARANTINE_BOARDERS_RESULTS_4">You receive a hail. "Eh, come in, incoming ship? Sorry, Captain, we have some malfunctions in our teleporter-targeting. Please do not be alarmed and stand by untill we can clear our signal."</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_DISTRESS_QUARANTINE_BOARDERS_RESULTS_4_c1_e">This doesn't seem right. Internal sensors show intruders appearing all over your ship.</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_DISTRESS_QUARANTINE_BOARDERS_RESULTS_4_c1_e_c1_e">You are hailed again. "I'm very sorry Captain, the diseased threatened to overrun us. We had to get rid of them." They teleported their infected to various locations on your ship!</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_DISTRESS_QUARANTINE_BOARDERS_RESULTS_5">You are hailed, "Incoming ship, we can no longer contain the diseased. Do you have anti-personnel weapons? We hope you can defend yourselves. Sorry... better you than us." They teleport their diseased aboard your ship!</text>
<text name="ce_event_QUARANTINE_PDS_c1">(Zoltan Shield) Reconfigure the shield frequencies to scramble the hostile artillery targeting.</text>
<text name="ce_event_QUARANTINE_PDS_c1_e">Your advanced shield technology prevents the hostile artillery weapons from locking onto your vessel.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_QUARANTINE_PDS_TEXT_1">You drop into real space near a major settlement. The quarantine fleet has taken over local affairs and uses the planetary defense system to deter any arrival vessels.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_QUARANTINE_PDS_TEXT_2">You arrive at a planet under complete lockdown and are greeted by an automated message, "Warning! Quarantine Level 9 in effect, see FHA Act 17, article 2.2. Use of defense weapons is authorized under this regulation. You have been warned."</text>
<text name="ce_textList_QUARANTINE_PDS_TEXT_3">You receive an automated message from the local government, "Dear citizen, space travel in the entire sector is restricted due to the risk of spreading the infection. (see FHA Act 28, article 3.0.)"</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_QUARANTINE_PDS_LIST_1">A defense ship of the quarantine fleet bursts through the atmosphere of the planet. Looks like if you don't leave, they really will fire their planetary guns at you.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_QUARANTINE_PATROL_DESTROYED_1">The patrol ship could not stop you. You are't too happy about their demise but you had to defend yourself. The mission is paramount.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_QUARANTINE_PATROL_DESTROYED_2">The quarantine patrol ship breaks apart. You feel like this lockdown fleet might be bringing even more terror to this sector than the actual disease.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_QUARANTINE_PATROL_DESTROYED_3">A bright explosion scatters the pieces of the quarantine patrol ship in all directions. Soon the Rebels will have to deal with the local crisis. You doubt they could do much worse than this murder fleet.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_QUARANTINE_PATROL_DESTROYED_4">Your last shot connects directly with the craft's breached FTL drive, resulting in a gravitational anomaly that leaves nothing but a twisted and compressed chunk of metal for you to salvage. You wonder if you are saving or rather endangering lives by taking out the ship of the quarantine patrol.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_QUARANTINE_PATROL_DESTROYED_5">Another patrol ship breaks apart. Maybe they should have invested more in medical equipment than warships.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_DESTROYED_SHIP_QUARANTINE_DISEASE_TEXT_1">The ship is torn apart and the fire of the explosion sterilizes the wreckage. You hope its destruction will keep the disease from spreading further.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_DESTROYED_SHIP_QUARANTINE_DISEASE_TEXT_2">Your cruiser is showered with radiation as the ship's reactor core explodes. You hope this will have eliminated any traces of the disease in its wreckage.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_DESTROYED_SHIP_QUARANTINE_DISEASE_TEXT_3">The ship's ammunition ignites and quickly turns the craft into a charred husk. If the individuals aboard this ship where infected then they will have no more chance to transmit the disease.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_DESTROYED_SHIP_QUARANTINE_DISEASE_TEXT_4">A ship full of sick people explodes. You've done the ghastly job of the quarantine fleet for them.</text>

<text name="ce_textList_DEAD_CREW_DISEASE_TEXT_1">The remaining crew of the vessel have been eliminated. You work almost as efficiently as the quarantine fleet.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_DEAD_CREW_DISEASE_TEXT_2">The diseased crew has been put down. The quarantine fleet would probably appreciate the deed.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_DEAD_CREW_DISEASE_TEXT_3">All the sick crewmen have been killed aboard their ship. Entering it in order to salvage might still pose a serious health risk.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_DEAD_CREW_DISEASE_TEXT_4">All hostiles aboard the ship have been eliminated. Entering the craft and salvaging from it holds a certain risk. The disease might spread to your crew.</text>

The person claims to have been hiding from the infected and would do anything to escape the sector; for example serve aboard your ship.</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_DEAD_CREW_DISEASE_SAFE_1_c3_e">The potential recruit understands that you can't take the risk and is content to stay behind on the still functional ship.</text>

<text name="ce_textList_NOTHING_MANTIS_2">The only thing this beacon offers is a view of deep space and a brief respite from battles. For some this must be a welcome refuge. </text>
<text name="ce_textList_NOTHING_MANTIS_7">The FTL beacon beacon you arrive at is polished and in pristine condition. The Mantis must have extended their local network just recently.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_NOTHING_MANTIS_8">Your arrival in this desolate sector scares away a rare Mantis engineering vessel, one of the insectoids few crafts not completely built for combat. It seems their crew just finished setting up this node recently.</text>
<text name="ce_event_START_BEACON_MANTIS_ACTUAL_c14_e">Undisturbed as you are here, you can lay out some mines around the beacon while the FTL charges. The Rebel forces will have to avoid this beacon, clear the minefield or suffer heavy damage. All possibilities will considerably delay their fleet.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_START_BEACON_MANTIS_TEXT_2">You've arrived in a sector controlled by the Mantis. Their expansion to this sector has already cost many lives. You should be careful here.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_START_BEACON_MANTIS_TEXT_3">You've entered a recently established Mantis hive cluster. Some civilian settlements remain, but most of the sentient individuals that lived here have been murdered or made their way out of the sector.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_START_BEACON_MANTIS_TEXT_4">You've entered one of the many Mantis hive clusters. Traveling through these areas of space is no joke. You should be vigilant.</text>
<text name="ce_event_CE_MANTIS_CAPTURE_COMMANDO">You come across an Engi wreck with one life sign aboard, it turns out to be the sole survivor of the Mantis boarding party that wiped out the ship's crew. He's in no state to fight and he's brought aboard.</text>
<text name="ce_event_CE_MANTIS_CAPTURE_COMMANDO_c3">(Mantis Crew) Interrogate him.</text>
<text name="ce_event_CE_MANTIS_CAPTURE_COMMANDO_c4_e">Your mind control device allows you to quickly get his story without resistance. It appears the boarding party was attempting to steal an weapon that the Engi ship was transporting. However, their team was wiped out by drones.</text>
<text name="ce_event_CE_MANTIS_CAPTURE_COMMANDO_c4_e_c1_e">You find the weapon in a hidden storage hold and decide to patch the ship up enough to let the Mantis leave.</text>
<text name="ce_event_CE_MANTIS_CAPTURE_COMMANDO_c5">(Slug Crew) Screen his intentions.</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_MANTIS_CAPTURE_COMMANDO_SLUG_1">"I sense embarrassment but gratefulnesses in him, Captain." You decide to help patch up the Engi ship and the Mantis takes off. "Grr, you take the bounty, I take the ship. Next time we see each other, we fight!" He jumps away without another word.</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_MANTIS_CAPTURE_COMMANDO_SLUG_2">"I sense embarrassment in him, Captain, but he just wants to get away from here." You help patch up the Engi ship and the Mantis takes off without another word. Your Slug crewman senses that he is grateful though. He leaves some supplies behind.</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_MANTIS_CAPTURE_COMMANDO_SLUG_3">"I sense embarrassment and a lot of hate, Captain. He thinks you are weak and he will attempt to destroy you." Good to know. The Mantis commando shows no fear as the airlock doors are sealed. You press the switch and he's whisked out into the great black. The crew watch his body spiral away while salvaging from the ship.</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_MANTIS_CAPTURE_COMMANDO_RELEASE_1">You help patch up the Engi ship and he takes off. "Grr, you take the bounty, I take the ship. Next time we see each other, we fight!" He jumps away without another word.</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_MANTIS_CAPTURE_COMMANDO_RELEASE_2">You help patch up the Engi ship and he takes off without another word. You have to guess that he is grateful though; he leaves some supplies behind.</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_MANTIS_CAPTURE_COMMANDO_KILL_1">The Mantis commando shows no fear as the airlock's inner doors are sealed and space prepares to take him. You press the switch and then he's gone, whisked out into the great black. You send the crew in to salvage from the ship.</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_MANTIS_CAPTURE_COMMANDO_TALK_2">After a short time alone with the commando, you are told he wishes to join the crew. Although you are surprised at the commando's willingness to swap allegiances, you trust your crew member's judgment about him.</text>
<text name="ce_event_CE_MANTIS_SPARRING">You are hailed by a small Mantis ship. For once, their message doesn't seem immediately threatening and a quick scan reveals deactivated weaponry. "Greetings, meat bags. You have entered sacred Mantis sparring grounds. Have your crew fight our champion and you will be rewarded. Refuse and you will die."</text>
<text name="ce_event_CE_MANTIS_SPARRING_c1">Draw straws to see which crewmember you send.</text>
<text name="ce_event_CE_MANTIS_SPARRING_c2">(Clonebay) Ask for volunteers.</text>
<text name="ce_event_CE_MANTIS_SPARRING_c2_e">One of your crewmen does not fear the trauma associated with death due to Mantis melee. They volunteer to go sparring and, after a few dozens of incarnations, actually get a fighting chance against the champion. The Mantis quickly realize where you take all these identical crewmen from. "Well fought, although true warriors battle without being backed up. The thrill of combat is much greater then."</text>
<text name="ce_event_CE_MANTIS_SPARRING_c3">(Mantis Crew) Send your Mantis over.</text>
<text name="ce_event_CE_MANTIS_SPARRING_c4">(Rock Crew) Send your Rockman over.</text>
<text name="ce_event_CE_MANTIS_SPARRING_c4_e">The Mantis are amazed as their champion's claw glances off your Rock crewmember's stony skin. It finishes the Mantis with a powerful punch. They teleport your crewmember back saying, "A mighty warrior indeed. The reward is yours."</text>
<text name="ce_event_CE_MANTIS_SPARRING_c5">(Crystal Crew) Send your Crystal over.</text>
<text name="ce_event_CE_MANTIS_SPARRING_c5_e">The Mantis are amazed as their champion's claw glances off your Crystal crewmember's crystalline skin. It flings crystal left and right, and finally the champion fails to dodge one. They teleport your crewmember back saying, "We have never seen such a warrior. Please, take this."</text>
<text name="ce_event_CE_MANTIS_SPARRING_c6_e">This was not what the Mantis wanted to hear. Power levels in their weaponry increase rapidly.</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_CE_MANTIS_SPARRING_MANTIS_1">Your Mantis crewmember fights well, but is bested in the end. They teleport your crewmember back saying, "Your crewman must be without pride, being your servent. But even for one of us, they fight well. You will be rewarded."</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_CE_MANTIS_SPARRING_MANTIS_2">Your Mantis crewmember gets in a few solid hits, and manages to knock out the champion. They teleport your crewmember back saying, "It is only expected that one of us can defeat another, with some luck. Still, the reward is yours."</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_CE_MANTIS_SPARRING_MEATBAG_1">Your crewmember fights well, but the Mantis are a warrior race. Even though they say this is sparring, a slice from the Mantis champion's claw nearly cuts your crewmember in half. They teleport your crewmember back saying, "You meatbags are far too squishy. That fight is hardly worth a pittance."</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_CE_MANTIS_SPARRING_MEATBAG_1_c1">Try to stabilize your crewman.</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_CE_MANTIS_SPARRING_MEATBAG_1_c2">(Improved Medbay) Put your crewman into medical stasis.</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_CE_MANTIS_SPARRING_MEATBAG_1_c2_e">Your fast response and advanced medbay let you quickly patch up your crewmember. The Mantis champion laughs, and says "Impressive... usually, I can cut you meatbags in two. I suppose that was worth something."</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_CE_MANTIS_SPARRING_MEATBAG_4">Amazingly, your crewmember manages to get in a lucky shot and knock out the Mantis champion. A collective gasp runs through the audience, and they hail you again: "Your crewmember is indeed mighty. Perhaps you would be willing to part with him? We offer a great price!"</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_CE_MANTIS_SPARRING_MEATBAG_4_c1">That offer could be vital to our survival. Let your crewmember go with the Mantis.</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_CE_MANTIS_SPARRING_MEATBAG_4_c1_e">Your crewman is not exactly at ease with this decision.</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_CE_MANTIS_SPARRING_MEATBAG_4_c2">Take your crewman back.</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_CE_MANTIS_SPARRING_MEATBAG_4_c2_e">"It's a shame... Oh well, the prize is yours."</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_CE_MANTIS_SPARRING_STABILIZE_1">You try to stem the flow of blood, but your crewmember is just too heavily injured. The Mantis do offer something called a "triumphant trophy burial" for them, saying this has happened before. What a waste.</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_CE_MANTIS_SPARRING_STABILIZE_1_clone">Your defeated crewmembers body is reconstructred in the clonbay. They ask to never be sent on such an assignment again.</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_CE_MANTIS_SPARRING_STABILIZE_2">You manage to stem the flow of blood just in time, and your crewmember is saved! The Mantis champion laughs, and says "Impressive... usually, I can cut you meatbags in two. I suppose that was worth something."</text>
<text name="ce_event_CE_MANTIS_GAMBLE">This node is currently home to a Mantis leisure ship, a place of brothels and combat arenas for warriors to release steam. When they scan your inventory they indicate that you're eligible to engage in a grand game of chance.</text>
<text name="ce_event_CE_MANTIS_GAMBLE_c4">(Slug Crew) Bet 50 scrap and cheat.</text>
<text name="ce_event_CE_MANTIS_GAMBLE_c4_e">Your Slug crew member at your side, you watch over the view-screen as two Mantis juveniles get ready for combat. "Any good guess who is going to win?"</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_MANTIS_GAMBLE_CHEAT_1">"I cannot forssee the future, Captain, but the blue Mantiss sssemss far more determined and viciouss." You make the bet.

<text name="ce_eventList_MANTIS_GAMBLE_CHEAT_2">"I cannot forssee the future, Captain, but the blue Mantiss is suprisingly scared of the fight. Actually... ha, the fight isss fixed! The blue Mantiss sold itss life in order to earn money for itss clan." You make the bet and the fight starts. The blue Mantis puts up a fight, but suddenly drops his guard. The one in red ends the fight with a single key swipe. You claim your winnings!</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_MANTIS_GAMBLE_CHEAT_3">"I cannot forssee the future, Captain, but the red Mantiss sssemss to posses far more self-control and experience." You make the bet and the fight starts. The blue Mantis seems assured to win, scoring numerous hits on his enemy. However, the one in red ends the fight with a single key swipe. You claim your winnings!</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_MANTIS_GAMBLE_CHEAT_4">"I cannot forssee the future, Captain, but the blue Mantiss sssemss far more determined and viciouss." You make the bet. The fight starts and the blue Mantis seems assured to win, scoring numerous hits on his enemy. However, the one in red ends the fight with a single lucky swipe.</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_MANTIS_GAMBLE_CHEAT_4_c1_e">You transfer over the scrap that you bet and quit while you still have a ship to take off in.</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_MANTIS_GAMBLE_CHEAT_4_c2_e">You are able to get out of firing range of the cruiser before it can react. However, a smaller ship breaks off from a patrol and moves in to engage.</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_MANTIS_GAMBLE_CHEAT_5">"I cannot forssee the future, Captain, but the blue Mantiss sssemss far more determined and viciouss." You make the bet. The fight starts and the Mantis in blue gets pressed into a corner soon. Suddenly the video transmission is interrupted.</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_MANTIS_GAMBLE_CHEAT_5_c1_e">Your receive a hail, "Our scanners show squishy telepaths on board your ship. That is against the rules. You tried to cheat us and will face our wrath!" A nearby fighter craft starts targeting you.</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_MANTIS_GAMBLE_BLUE_1">The Mantis in blue gets pressed into a corner, but he lashes out at the last moment, decapitating his opponent. You claim your winnings!</text>
<text name="ce_textList_MANTIS_FIGHT_12">Something vicious looms. It's the Mantis.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_MANTIS_FIGHT_19">Children on Earth are told terrible tales of the blood stained Mantis invasion ships - much like the one bearing down on you now - which once threatened the planet. You order weapons free!</text>
<text name="ce_event_MANTIS_NAMED_THIEF">You cross paths with a Mantis ship that looks to have had dozens of layers of armor-plating added over what must have been a hundred year career. Its Captain is legendary thief KazaaakplethKilik. Your crew look frightened.</text>
<text name="ce_event_MANTIS_NAMED_THIEF_c1">(Mantis Crew) Attempt to hail him.</text>
<text name="ce_event_MANTIS_NAMED_THIEF_c1_e">Your Mantis crewman steps forward. He and KazaaakplethKilik perform a weird kind of alien haka. You, meanwhile, charge the battle systems.</text>
<text name="ce_event_MANTIS_BOARDERS">A derelict and still smoking Mantis vessel floats by. The battle must have been recent; its teleporters activate.</text>
<text name="ce_event_MANTIS_BOARDERS_c1">(Teleporter Disruptor) Not today.</text>
<text name="ce_event_MANTIS_BOARDERS_c1_e">With the disruptor field online, the Mantis won't go anywhere. A well prepared salvo blasts the derelict vessel to pieces. Nothing of it remains salvageable.</text>
<text name="ce_event_MANTIS_BOARDERS_c2_e">The surviving crew beam aboard. Prepare for a fight!</text>
<text name="ce_event_MANTIS_CREW_c3">(Slug Crew) Can you sense if there is someone in the pod?</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_MANTIS_CREW_SLUG_LIST_1">Your Slug concentrates for a second. "I indeed sssense a Mantisss insside. It'ss alive, confussed and very ssscared. I cannot foressee its intentionss."</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_MANTIS_CREW_SLUG_LIST_2">Your Slug concentrates for a second. "I indeed sssensse a Mantisss insside. It'ss alive, confussed and very ssscared. I cannot foressee its intentionss."</text>

Maybe we sshould help them?" You free the human and sedate them immediately. A rare survivor of Mantis captivity. Once they wake up in the medbay, they offer to join your crew for a time.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_MANTIS_FIGHT_ESCAPE_ASB_TEXT_1">You find yourself deep in Mantis space. Newly founded breeding colonies dot the planets of this system and a patrol ship crosses path with your ship. You order to stay away from the planets to not get shot at with anti-ship artillery.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_MANTIS_FIGHT_ESCAPE_ASB_TEXT_2">A small Mantis cruiser is broadcasting a repeating message on a wide-band frequency, "All non-Mantis ships that enter our territory are forfeit. Lower your shields and surrender if you value your lives." You are out still outside the range of the Mantis defense batteries and decide to risk a confrontation.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_MANTIS_FIGHT_ESCAPE_ASB_TEXT_3">You detect a small military outpost and a few freighters nearby. This mineral rich planet in an isolated location would be perfect for an illegal Mantis mining operation. As you consider your options, a ship launches from the outpost. You try to stay outside the range of their defense batteries and prepare for a fight.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_MANTIS_FIGHT_ESCAPE_ASB_TEXT_4">You discover yet another unlicensed and uncharted Mantis colony. They certainly waste no time expanding their claims. A Mantis ship moves to intercept you before you can jump away. The Mantis have not yet cover the beacon with their ASBs. You will be safe from their fire here.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_MANTIS_FIGHT_ESCAPE_ASB_TEXT_5">A small military craft hails you and a Mantis captain appears on your receiver. "All local human colonies have been punished for the Federation's transgressions. Submit to processing." You realize that you are outside the range of the Mantis occupied ASBs and decide to battle it out.</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_MANTIS_FIGHT_ESCAPE_LIST_1">You speed after the Mantis and are relieved when seeing their after-burner fires fade away. Looks like their backup engines won't get them far enough. You continue the fighting just outside the range of the Mantis' ABS.</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_MANTIS_FIGHT_ESCAPE_LIST_2">You are thrown back into your seat as the ship accelerates to full impulse speed. Despite your pilots effort, you only catch up once the ship has reached the colony. The Mantis find new confidence because you are now in reach of their ASBs. They turn and attack again.</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_MANTIS_FIGHT_ESCAPE_LIST_4">You catch up with the ship near the breeding colonies and are greeted by full spread ASB fire. The Mantis defenders are overzealous and fire without care for their own forces.</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_MANTIS_FIGHT_ESCAPE_LIST_5">You reach the Mantis colonies and assume to be greeted by ASB fire. You receive a hail instead: "Pathetic meatsacks, you are not event worthy of our payloads! But the cowardly warriors you pursue are even greater filth than you. They are forbidden of returning to their breeding grounds, we shall aid you in exterminating their breed-line." You get some unexpected artillery support.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_BS_EVENT_MANTIS_TEXT_1">A Mantis military station appears on the screen. Alongside it drift the remains of several ships from different factions. Your crew is determined not to be their next victim!</text>
<text name="ce_textList_BS_EVENT_MANTIS_TEXT_2">A Mantis military outpost hails your ship. "Disgusting aliens! Your Federation is weak; you shall fall victim to our claws!"</text>
<text name="ce_textList_BS_EVENT_MANTIS_TEXT_3">You detect a small military outpost close to the beacon and a few freighters nearby. This mineral rich planet in an isolated location would be perfect for an illegal Mantis mining operation. As you consider your options, the ships jump away and the station starts a targeting sequence. Prepare for a tough fight.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_BS_EVENT_MANTIS_TEXT_4">You discover yet another unlicensed and uncharted Mantis colony. They certainly waste no time expanding their claims. A Mantis station is guarding the beacon and tries to prevent you from escaping. They don't want you to tell the story.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_BS_EVENT_MANTIS_TEXT_5">A fully weaponized Mantis station hails you and about five Mantis appear on your screen. "We control this sector now. All Federation sympathizers will be executed by blade. Prepare to die!"</text>
<text name="ce_textList_BS_EVENT_MANTIS_TEXT_6">A Mantis station adorned with ceremonial and functional weapons guards this planet and opens fire. This will not be easy.</text>
<text name="ce_event_CE_MANTIS_MASS_BOARDING">You ran into what appears to be a Mantis invasion fleet charging FTL at this beacon. Luckily, most of the ships are just unarmed troop transporters, only equipped with rudimentary teleporter devices. Looks like they are heading out of the sector.</text>
<text name="ce_event_CE_MANTIS_MASS_BOARDING_c1">Attack the convoy.</text>
<text name="ce_event_CE_MANTIS_MASS_BOARDING_c1_e">Wherever these Mantis might be heading, it's sure that they are up to no good. You can save lives here by killing a lot of Mantis. Teleporters warm up all over the convoy as you move in for an attack run.</text>
<text name="ce_event_CE_MANTIS_MASS_BOARDING_c1_e_c1">(Teleporter Disruptor) Keep them away with the disruption field.</text>
<text name="ce_event_CE_MANTIS_MASS_BOARDING_c1_e_c1_e">You disruptor augment is preventing the Mantis from boarding you, but one of the few armed escort craft intercepts your ship before you can open fire on the invasion ships.</text>
<text name="ce_event_CE_MANTIS_MASS_BOARDING_c1_e_c2_e">One of the few armed escort craft intercepts your cruiser before you can open fire on the convoy. Additional Mantis beam aboard from the troop transporters.</text>
<text name="ce_event_CE_MANTIS_MASS_BOARDING_c2_e">The insectoids do not intend to risk a direct engagement, although a few worriers seem unwilling to leave it at that. One of the troopship gets ready to teleport.</text>
<text name="ce_event_CE_MANTIS_MASS_BOARDING_c2_e_c1_e">The troop transport immediately gets back into formation when the crew registers your augment activating. Soon the whole convoy jumps away in unison. You have to assume that another Federation or Engi colony will have a very bad day soon...</text>
<text name="ce_event_CE_MANTIS_MASS_BOARDING_c2_e_c2_e">"Mantis aboard the ship Captain. Security alert!"</text>
<text name="ce_textList_CE_PDS_MANTIS_TEXT_1">You ventured deep into Mantis space and discovered what must be one of the main hive clusters in this sector. The planetary hatcheries are so densely populated that the computer cannot calculate how many of the aliens are actually bred here.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_CE_PDS_MANTIS_TEXT_2">You arrive in close vicinity of yet another newly established Mantis colony. Hatcheries are built, warships are constructed in orbit and the insectoid beings have already set up planetary defenses. You wonder if these creatures might actually be a greater threat to the Galaxy than the Rebels.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_CE_PDS_MANTIS_TEXT_3">You drop into real-space and have to mark another unlicensed Mantis colony on the star chart. This clearly violates the Post Federation-Mantis War treaty. If the Federation survives the Rebellion, it will have to bring down the hammer on these insectoid beings once more.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_CE_PDS_MANTIS_TEXT_4">A major Mantis settlement hails you and a uniformed officer appears on your receiver. "What is the meaning of this foolish transgression? You invaded our domain and will be punished!"</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_CE_PDS_MANTIS_LIST_1">The local planetary defense force immediately responds to your arrival. A Mantis spotter is heading right for you. It surely will try to mark your ship for a planetary artillery strike.</text>
<text name="ce_event_CE_MINEFIELD_MANTIS">The ship drops below FTL speed and warning signs immediately fill up the main screen. You jumped right into a huge minefield the Mantis must have put up here.</text>
<text name="ce_event_CE_MINEFIELD_MANTIS_c1">(Minelauncher) Deactivate the mines from afar.</text>
<text name="ce_event_CE_MINEFIELD_MANTIS_c1_e">Your minelauncher remotely disarms the explosives. You take some of the mines aboard for further use, but are interrupted by a paroling Mantis minelayer ship.</text>
<text name="ce_event_CE_MINEFIELD_MANTIS_c2">(Advanced Navigation AI) Plot a safe course through the field.</text>
<text name="ce_event_CE_MINEFIELD_MANTIS_c2_e">Your navigation computer calculates a complex course that lets you avoid triggering any mines. A nearby Mantis minelayer crew seems to be disappointed about the ineffectiveness of their trap and charges after you.</text>
<text name="ce_event_CE_MINEFIELD_MANTIS_c3_e">You try to slowly maneuver out of the field, but a Mantis minelayer starts to take potshots at you and a few mines nearby activate their homing magnets.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_STORE_MANTIS_1">Upon arriving at the beacon you're hailed by a well-spoken Mantis, "Hail, traveler. These are dangerous times. Perhaps you find yourself in need of our services?" He appears to be a trader.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_STORE_MANTIS_2">Uncertain about what you'll discover at this beacon you scan the surroundings. You detect several warnings on wide-band channels discouraging any violence in protected trade-space. Perhaps you can find some wares nearby.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_STORE_MANTIS_4">Identifying a Mantis trading post ahead, you signal them so that your approach won't be taken as a threat. The leader hails you, "You have scrap? Quickly, come dock before the warriors see you."</text>
<text name="ce_textList_STORE_MANTIS_6">Mantis industrial installations manufacture invasion ships en masse near this planet. You passively scan the factories. Hundreds of Engi slaves are working in them. A corrupt Mantis clan lord contacts you and offers to sell some of the excess production.</text>

<text name="ce_eventList_TE_STORE_MANTIS_ACTUAL_1_c8">The Mantis can't produce enough food on their own to supply their ever expanding colonies. The rations could strike a good price here. [Sell Space Rations for about 90 Scrap]</text>

<text name="ce_textList_STORE_MANTIS_BUY_TEXT_1">You transfer the scrap. The cargo is loaded under heavy security, which makes the process take quite some time. You have time to look at their ship gear ads.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_STORE_MANTIS_BUY_TEXT_2">After transferring the scrap a Mantis start to argue with the trader in the kliktish language. You don't understand a word but you have to assume it's about ripping you off. The argument ends when the trader suddenly beheads his colleague with a single swipe. He politely apologizes for the inconvenience and lets you see some reserved wares.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_STORE_MANTIS_BUY_TEXT_3">The Mantis have no cargo drones here and the goods have to be transferred via a time-consuming docking maneuver. While waiting, you get a chance to check the ship equipment they offer here.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_STORE_MANTIS_BUY_TEXT_4">A small Mantis shuttle slowly ferries the goods to your ship. You fear they might try to somehow cheat you, but after some time the complete freight has arrived. You had a look at the ship gear they offer in the meantime.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_STORE_MANTIS_SELL_TEXT_3">After time-consuming haggling you reach an agreement. The Mantis bluntly explains, "You only get an advance. Transfer the cargo to our shop now, then you get the rest."</text>
<text name="ce_textList_STORE_MANTIS_SELL_TEXT_4">When Mantis haggle with each other, this usually involves some kind of macho-insectoid swordplay. The trader seems kind of lost when negotiating with other species. After long talks, he only reluctantly agrees to transfer an advance. He orders you, "Unload the goods at the shop now!"</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_TE_STORE_MANTIS_LIST_BOOSTED_1">You consider making a deal here. The cargo teleporter will allow you to exchange goods quickly.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_ROCK_FIGHT_DESTROYED_1">Victory! You narrowly avoid a hull breach as one of the Rock crew is propelled by the explosion straight towards your bridge.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_ROCK_FIGHT_DESTROYED_2">The Rock ship disintegrates, a jump drive burnout turning its crew to stardust.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_ROCK_FIGHT_DESTROYED_3">The enemy hull is torn apart by a final volley. They're with the sandman now.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_ROCK_FIGHT_DESTROYED_4">You blink and they're gone. All that remains of the Rock ship are the more sturdier pieces of hull infrastructure; there might be something you can use.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_ROCK_FIGHT_DESTROYED_5">Rockmen rarely go without a fight, but go they do. Their ship in pieces; you're free to take what you can.</text>

<text name="ce_textList_ROCK_DIPLOMAT_DESTROYED_2">The dim shape of the Crystal-Rock hybrid ship eventually succumbs to the assault, exploding into a cloud of crystal armor and metal.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_ROCK_DIPLOMAT_DESTROYED_3">The final shots chip away at the hull of the crystal-plated Rock vessel, causing it to shatter into thousands of pieces, usable scrap and metalwork intertwined with the debris.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_ROCK_DIPLOMAT_DESTROYED_4">The bastard vessel submits to the force of the attack and breaks apart into crystal shards and assorted scrap materials.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_ROCK_DIPLOMAT_DESTROYED_5">The shiny blue ship before you submits to the barrage from your arsenal and shatters into bits, the inner workings ripe for the picking.</text>
<text name="ce_event_ROCK_DIPLOMAT_SHIP_SURRENDER_c3">(Crystal Crew) Have your Crystal crewmen to deescalate the situation.</text>
<text name="ce_event_ROCK_DIPLOMAT_SHIP_SURRENDER_c3_e">Your crewmen request to talk to the crystal envoy aboard the diplomat vessel. The strange beings have a long conversation in their strange resonance language. Afterwards, your crewmen informs you that this incident will not cause any disturbance in Federation-Crystal relations. The crystal envoy apologizes, also in the name of the Rock, and sends over a crate with supplies.</text>
<text name="ce_event_NOTHING_ROCK_c12_e">You quickly lay some mines around the beacon while the FTL charges. The Rebel forces will have to avoid this area, clear the minefield or suffer heavy damage. All possibilities will considerably delay their fleet.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_NOTHING_ROCK_3">You arrive and detect signs of battle. A few ships are taking passes at each other near a small station. You don't know if it's a territory issue, a contest, or a rite of passage but you decide it's best to stay out of it.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_NOTHING_ROCK_6">You see a small trading post and ask about refueling but they respond, "Go away! We don't serve your kind here."</text>

<text name="ce_event_START_BEACON_ROCK_HOME_ACTUAL_c2_e_c12_e">Undisturbed as you are here, you can lay some mines while the FTL charges. You put up a hazard beacon as well to warn the locals. The Rebel forces will have to avoid this area, clear the minefield or suffer heavy damage. All possibilities will considerably delay their fleet.</text>
<text name="ce_event_ROCK_UNLOCK3_c1_e">I am convinced of your strength and pledge to assist your cause. We'll immediately send an advanced cruiser to the Federation fleet and we will prepare our warships to move out.</text>

<text name="ce_event_CE_ROCK_NURSERY">Fluctuating life signs are reported near the surface of a hazy, pock-marked moon in the vicinity. It seems this is a Rock nursery where the young are 'acclimatized' to their religion - only there's been some kind of coup and the students are running amok!</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_ROCK_NURSERY_STUDENTS_2">The fight goes poorly, and your team eventually finds itself out on the flank with a wounded Rock combatant in tow. They make a desperate push for the shuttle coordinates, but one falls. The survivor helps the injured Rock aboard.</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_ROCK_NURSERY_STUDENTS_4">Your team comes under heavy fire. One is blinded by a flash bomb and staggers past the lip of a quarry and to their death far below, the other succeeds in joining with friendly forces and ultimately claims control of the institution!</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_ROCK_NURSERY_STUDENTS_5">As the battle proceeds the action moves away from your team's location. During the lull they're able to secure some abandoned weapons. By the time they're done the battle is largely over and they return to the ship.</text>
<text name="ce_event_CE_ROCK_ZOLTAN_HELP">It seems a Zoltan ship came here to liberate a Rock settlement from their 'oppressive belief system', and that said Rock did not appreciate it. The chase is headed your way and the Zoltan and their pursuers will be here at any moment!</text>
<text name="ce_event_CE_ROCK_ZOLTAN_HELP_c1_e">The... extreme nature of Rock faith is well-known, the Zoltan can hardly be blamed for trying to broaden their horizons. The pursuing Rock ship quickly assesses the situation and decides two captured alien ships are better than one.</text>
<text name="ce_event_CE_ROCK_ZOLTAN_HELP_c2">Stay and attack the Zoltan.</text>
<text name="ce_event_CE_ROCK_ZOLTAN_HELP_c2_e">This is Rock territory, and therefore Rock law - the Zoltan should have known better than to interfere. Maybe the Rock will reward your initiative?</text>
<text name="ce_ship_ROCK_ZOLTAN_HELP_ROCK_deadCrew">With the ship's crew dead you salvage the ship before contacting the Zoltan.</text>
<text name="ce_ship_ROCK_ZOLTAN_HELP_ZOLTAN_deadCrew">By the time the Rock ship arrives you've all but tied a bow around their quarry. The injured and dying Zoltan are easily taken into custody. After the having taken possession of the Zoltan ship, the Rock grudgingly transfers over what you assume must be the bounty.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_ROCK_SHIP_6">You notice a Rock ship performing combat exercises. However, they quickly change their course to engage your ship. They apparently treat unregistered alien ships as handy target practice. </text>
<text name="ce_textList_ROCK_SHIP_9">The Rock military has found you. "Foreign vessel. You have invaded our domain. Surrender and we might let you live."</text>
<text name="ce_event_ROCK_MANTIS_HUNTER">A Mantis ship here is adorned with Rock body parts! It would be a gorier display if they had internal organs, but the message is clear enough, this is a hunter of a very specialized kind.</text>
<text name="ce_event_ROCK_MANTIS_HUNTER_c3_e">Before they have a chance to react, you ram your ship into theirs, causing irreparable damage to their engines. Luckily your ship's armored hull is hardly dented from the impact. The Mantis ship careens away and you move in to attack.</text>

<text name="ce_event_ROCK_MANTIS_FREIGHTER_c5">(Repair Unit) Teleport a repair kit.</text>
<text name="ce_event_ROCK_MANTIS_FREIGHTER_c5_e">While the two Mantis fight, you teleport a repair unit to aid the Rock ship. The device fixes the ship up enough to make at least a single jump. You're surprised when, instead, they embark on a suicide run on the two Mantis, which results in the obliteration of all three!</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_ROCK_MANTIS_FREIGHTER_LIST_1">The Mantis craft are both too busy slaughtering one another to notice you. Eventually the smaller ship gets the upper hand when it overrides the enemy door system and flushes the crew into space. Now's the time!</text>
<text name="ce_event_ROCK_ATHIEST">You encounter a small craft with minimal propulsion. Its Rock crew member explains that the Rock home-world is run on lies and propaganda that keep the populace in check, and that they want no part of it.</text>
<text name="ce_event_ROCK_ATHIEST_c1">Tell them their Gods sent them here to join your crew.</text>

<text name="ce_event_ROCK_QUEST_MARRIAGE_c1_e_c2_e">"I was led to believe your kind did not know mercy. I will join you, but quickly, we must jump away - they will not tolerate..." She's interrupted by weapons fire from the Basilisk's escort!</text>
<text name="ce_event_ROCK_BOARDERS_SHIP_c1">(Teleporter Disruptor) Don't let them get on board!</text>
<text name="ce_event_ROCK_BOARDERS_SHIP_c1_e">The Rockmen can't get a teleporter lock and decide to attack with the usual brute force instead.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_ROCK_BOARDERS_SHIP_1">You passively scan a small Rock station that is next to the beacon, however they must not have appreciated your curiosity. A Rock ship pulls away from the station and you register an incoming teleporter signal as well!</text>
<text name="ce_event_ROCK_BOARDERS_ASTEROID_c2_e">A loud clunk reverberates through the ship. At first you think the hull has been hit but the noise came from some Rock intruders teleporting aboard the ship!</text>
<text name="ce_textList_ROCK_BOARDERS_ASTEROID_1">You arrive in an asteroid field and immediately begin evasive maneuvers. The ship AI warns you about several medium size asteroids on a direct collision course. There is an incoming teleporter signal as well.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_ROCK_BOARDERS_ASTEROID_2">Your shields are being taxed as the they deflect the debris from an asteroid field. As you weave your way between the rocks you happen upon a Rock pirate stronghold. You register teleport signatures.</text>
<text name="ce_event_ROCK_BOARDERS_SUN_c2_e">You hear the telltale sounds of a teleporter and hollow shouts, "Prepare to burn, fleshy meat-sack aliens!" A detonations in the engine room resonates through the entire ship. The Rock must have teleport bombs and breaching equipment as well. You order your crew to fend off the boarders and seize their supplies.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_ROCK_BOARDERS_SUN_1">As soon as you arrive the ship's computer puts a temperature warning on the vidscreen. Hostile teleporter targeting has been detected as well.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_ROCK_BOARDERS_SUN_2">With their high resistance to heat, outlaw Rocks often settle very close to stars. That is why it is hardly surprising when your ship detects a teleporter signal as you stumble past a hidden settlement.</text>
<text name="ce_event_ROCK_STARSHIP_MINE_c1_e_c2">(Adaptive Gel Suits) Have your crew suit up before sending them out to deal with the mine.</text>
<text name="ce_event_ROCK_STARSHIP_MINE_c1_e_c3_e">After drawing straws, a crew member goes out to fix a modified warhead to the mine. You detonate the missile in a way that dislodges it and it blows up shortly after. The ship takes some damage in the blasts, but you're still sailing.</text>

<text name="ce_event_ROCK_STARSHIP_MINE_c5_e">The mine deactivates in the last second and harmlessly bumps against your ship's hull. Everyone on board sights with relief. You take the device apart for scrap.</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_ROCK_STARSHIP_MINE_DEFUSE_SUITED_UP_1">Your crewmember dons the seals the gel suit and exits the airlock. They make quick work of the basic device and return inside to relief all round. The mine makes good scrap pickings too.</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_ROCK_STARSHIP_MINE_DEFUSE_SUITED_UP_2">Your crewmember seals the gel suit and exits the airlock. When they open up the mine housing, though, they panic. The red wire or the blue?! 3... 2... 1...</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_ROCK_STARSHIP_MINE_DEFUSE2_SUITED_UP_2">The weapon detonates. While the bridge is illuminated by flames pouring from the hull, your bomb disposal volunteer struggles to stabilize their trajectory.

<text name="ce_textList_CE_ROCK_BLACKHOLE_STUFF_SHIP_TEXT_3">You will need more fuel than usual to escape the strong gravitational field. Even worse: Time passes slower here and the Rebel fleet still pursues you in realtime. You try to figure out a jump vector that does not cause too much damage to your ship.

<text name="ce_textList_CE_ROCK_BLACKHOLE_STUFF_SHIP_TEXT_4">Suns, black holes and other devastating space bodies play a central role in the Rock religion.

<text name="ce_textList_BS_EVENT_ROCK_TRADE_TEXT_1">Identifying a Rock trading post in close vicinity, you signal them so that your approach won't be taken as a threat. A Rock merchant chief hails you, "Puny aliens. We shall let you continue on your way, but we will keep a close watch. Charge your FTL now and leave!" Is anyone not rude here?</text>
<text name="ce_textList_BS_EVENT_ROCK_TRADE_TEXT_2">Upon jumping in, you receive a video massage from a heavily armored Rock station. "We only honor the mightiest ship commanders with an opportunity to trade here. You are not even of our kind. Leave!"</text>
<text name="ce_textList_BS_EVENT_ROCK_TRADE_TEXT_3">As your ship slips into real-space you detect an small but extremely dense rock station outfitted for trade. They refuse all hails and you have to assume that they are not interested in making business with you.</text>

<text name="ce_textList_BS_EVENT_ROCK_COLONY_TEXT_1">Identifying a Rock colony in a nearby asteroid field, you signal once more that you are friendly. They fire a few unarmed warning-missiles as a response.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_BS_EVENT_ROCK_COLONY_TEXT_2">Upon arrival, your navigator informs you that you jumped a few klicks off the mark. You realize its better this way, because at the far side of the beacon lies an asteroid patch harboring a small Rock colony. They send threatening messages and demand that you leave immediately.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_BS_EVENT_ROCK_COLONY_TEXT_3">As your ship slips into real-space, you detect an small asteroid patch, almost completely depleted of its natural resources. The Rock mining colony at it's perimiter refuses all hails. Passive scans show their stores are full of materials.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_BS_EVENT_ROCK_COLONY_TEXT_4">You receive a hail from within a large asteroid field nearby. "This mining area and the adjacent habitats are off-limits. Leave now, wobbly aliens!"</text>
<text name="ce_textList_BS_EVENT_ROCK_OUTPOST_TEXT_1">You arrive at the beacon facing a fully weaponized and heavily armored Rock station. They refuse comm contact and instead start targeting you. It seems there is no easy way out of this.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_BS_EVENT_ROCK_OUTPOST_TEXT_2">After jump completion the ship's computer politely informs you about a threat level six Rock outpost right behind you, already firing warning shots. You try to reason, but the Rock officer has no sympathy for your intention to charge your FTL at his beacon. Soon they full out engage you.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_BS_EVENT_ROCK_OUTPOST_TEXT_3">A fully armed Rock weapons platform floats near this beacon. You receive a hail, "Your territorial transgression will not be tolerated. In the name of the holy words we shall smash your ship to bits." Armed engagements really seem inevitable in Rock territory.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_BS_EVENT_ROCK_OUTPOST_ASTEROID_TEXT_1">A heavily defended Rock station has drifted with this beacon into a massive asteroid field. The installation seems to have no problems with the constant barrage of stones and dirt. They kindly inform you, "This is the personal asteroid mine of the Grand Basilisk of Molten Nero VII. Trespassers will be shot." They load weapons.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_BS_EVENT_ROCK_OUTPOST_ASTEROID_TEXT_2">Jumping in you have to pull to starboard hard to avoid a massive asteroid floating right in the middle of this field. Only then do you realize that you just narrowly avoided colliding with a Rock outpost. You are instantly hailed, "We accept your challenge, feeble aliens. Load your weapons." It seems your maneuver provoked them.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_BS_EVENT_ROCK_OUTPOST_ASTEROID_TEXT_3">You can tell from the look of its hull plating that the fully weaponized Rock outpost in this asteroid field has resisted the stone-barrage here for ages.

<text name="ce_event_CE_MINEFIELD_ROCK_c1_e">Your minelauncher remotely activates the Rock safety protocols. The minefield is disarmed and you can even take some of the explosives aboard. This might come in handy. The Rock are shocekd by the ineffectiveness of their defensive measures. They decide to engage you in direct combat.</text>

<text name="ce_textList_NEBULA_ROCK_SMOG_LOW_PIRATE_TEXT_3">Decades of unchecked industrial pollution start to take their toll at this part of the sector. The dust clouds make a perfect ambush spot for pirates, you probably can be glad that only a single ship engages you.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_NEBULA_ROCK_SMOG_LOW_PIRATE_TEXT_4">The shields readjust their layer pattern as you jump to an industrial region. The space here is saturated with metallic dust. A derelict salvage yard floats near the jump node and a pirate ship detaches from the main structure.</text>

<text name="ce_textList_NEBULA_ROCK_ACID_PIRATE_TEXT_1">Acid eats away at your ship's hull while you wait for the FTL to charge. The heavily armored Rock ship that is roaming the beacon does not have to fear damage. The pirates fly circles around your ship and come closer and closer. Your hope the hull is still strong enough to withstand the incoming fire.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_NEBULA_ROCK_ACID_PIRATE_TEXT_2">Acid eats away at your ship's hull while you wait for the FTL to charge. Despite the dangerous environment, a Rock pirate is roaming the vicinity. They must be praying on ships weakened by the hazard.</text>

The advanced hull plating of Rock ships provides ample protection against this hazard. You aren't surprised when a Rock freebooter emerges from the mist and moves in on your position.</text>

<text name="ce_event_ROCK_CRYSTAL_c3_e">The Rock must be disappointed. With the Crystal aboard your ship, they cannot attack you without risking a minor diplomatic crisis. Their new allies would be upset. They send over a symbolic amount of scrap as a badly faked sign of goodwill and mockingly wish you a safe journey through their sector.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_ROCK_CRYSTAL_TEXT_1">A rare sight greats you at this beacon: Actual Rock diplomats. Their ship is equipped with the tech of the recently contacted crystal beings. A tight beam message informs you that you have interrupted important negotiations here. The Rock are eager to defend themselves.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_ROCK_CRYSTAL_TEXT_2">Waiting at the beacon, you intercept com chatter from a nearby Rock ship. It is communicating with an unidentified vessel of exotic design. The language used on coms is unknown to you, it consists mostly of deep, resonating sounds, till the Rock suddenly switch to galactic standard. "Wait, what is this? Spies! Change the channel and engage!" The Rock ship covers the escape of the foreign vessel.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_ROCK_CRYSTAL_TEXT_3">You jumped close to a modernized Rock dockyard. A ship equipped with unusual hull plating circles the beacon and contact you: "You have intruded into a secured zone. An honorable opportunity to test the fruits of our labor. Prepare to be targeted, filthy alien." You notice a shrouded figure with sparkling eyes flanking the high ranking captain. That is no Rock. What is going on here?</text>
<text name="ce_textList_ROCK_CRYSTAL_TEXT_4">A ship with markings of the Rock grand inquisition jumps to the beacon shortly after you. They hail: "What is this? You dare corrupt our holy void on this day, when our holy forefather just bless us with their visit? Prepare to be purged from this galactic plain, Alien instigators!"</text>
<text name="ce_textList_ROCK_CRYSTAL_TEXT_5">You notice a Rock ship with unusual hull plating. They hail: "You are considered a threat to an important diplomat on board our vessel. We have already called reinforcements and will defend ourselves in accordance with general system law." You are pretty sure that there is no paragraph legitimizing this kind of action, but you will have to deal with them somehow.</text>
<text name="ce_event_ROCK_CRYSTAL_DIPLOMAT">A Rock ship with exquisite crystalline hull plating hails you and a shrouded Rock figure appears on screen: "This is the ceremonial envoy of the Crystal realm speaking. We have heard a lot of the Federation from our young Rock children. Would you care to meet us? There is much to discuss."</text>

You should really visit our home world. Uncovering the ancient gateways that lead to it from this sector is one part of my mission here. Please allow me to send one of my disciples with you. This might aid both of us in our endeavor."</text>
<text name="ce_event_ROCK_CRYSTAL_DIPLOMAT_c3">Politely decline to meet the envoy.</text>
<text name="ce_event_ROCK_CRYSTAL_DIPLOMAT_c3_e">You explain that you are not authorized to speak on behalf of the Federation, but promise to forward the offer to the Federation government. The envoy sends his regards, as well as symbolic gift of scrap.</text>
<text name="ce_event_ROCK_CRYSTAL_DIPLOMAT_c4">Whatever the Rock are up to with these strange beings, it can not be good for the Federation. Engage the vessel!</text>
<text name="ce_event_ROCK_CRYSTAL_DIPLOMAT_c4_e">"This is a most tragic development. Although I have to admit that I have started to enjoy military engagements during the time spend with my ancient sons and daughters. I will give you, what they call 'a honorable death.'" The envoy ship activates its weapon clusters.</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_ROCK_CRYSTAL_DIPLOMAT_MEETING_1">Upon docking, the ceremonial vessel suddenly activates hidden weapon arrays and swings them towards your ship. Meanwhile, borders storm through the airlocks.</text>

<text name="ce_eventList_ROCK_CRYSTAL_DIPLOMAT_MEETING_1_c1_e">"We are well informed about the Federations influence in this galaxy and we also know all about your mission. The Rock people might appear primitive to you, but it is your stance towards them that is truly revolting. You should have known better. We cannot let you fulfill your mission.

<text name="ce_eventList_ROCK_CRYSTAL_DIPLOMAT_MEETING_2">You have your crew brush up their lessons on xeno-etiquette and dock to meet the envoy. During an official dinner, you discuss the current conflict and the recent contact made between the Rock people and the Crystal realm. The envoy is also very interested in Federation affairs.

<text name="ce_eventList_ROCK_CRYSTAL_DIPLOMAT_MEETING_3">During the meeting, the envoy enquires why his "children", the Rockmen, have so little sympathy for the Federation. One of your crewmen has lost relatives during the omega pacification and tries to make a point about the viciousness of the Rock Grand Inquisition. The discussion heats up quickly and you decide to leave before risking a full blown diplomatic incident.</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_ROCK_CRYSTAL_DIPLOMAT_MEETING_4">You meet the envoy in person and discuss the current state of the galaxy. "There is so little understanding between our ancient children and the Federation. We have revealed ourself to the Rock, because some of them follow an ill-fated path." The figure uncovers its head, showing its crystalline face. "Maybe it is time that we reveal ourself to you as well."</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_ROCK_CRYSTAL_DIPLOMAT_MEETING_4_c1_e">"I would like to travel with the Federation and learn more about it. But there is more: Hidden wormholes in Rock territory and the Rock home-worlds. Locating these is a part of my mission here. Perhaps you can take me to this sectors; in the end you might even be able to visit our realm and learn about our ways."</text>
<text name="ce_textList_STORE_ROCK_1">You cross paths with a Rock ship returning from a rare diplomatic mission. Equally surprising, the Captain responds to your hails and agrees to a mutual trade.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_STORE_ROCK_4">The Rock tolerate few aliens in their space, but even they seem to respect the wisdom of the Zoltan. A few of them have established a trading post in the hull of an abandoned capital ship.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_STORE_ROCK_5">You receive a hail on Federation frequencies, "You're Federation?! We- we weren't sure we'd ever see a friendly face again. There's little business here, perhaps you'd like to trade?"</text>

<text name="ce_textList_STORE_ROCK_BUY_TEXT_3">You hand over the crates with the scrap. The Rock cargo crew can't be persuaded to work faster. Most of them pretend they don't understand you. While waiting you get a chance to check the ship equipment they offer here.</text>

<text name="ce_textList_SLUG_FIGHT_DESTROYED_3">These telepathic beings did not foresee this, their impressive arsenal failed to repell yours and their destruction was the inevitable result.</text>

<text name="ce_eventList_CE_SURRENDER_SHIP_ATTACK_SLUG_2">You opponent was scared like a Slug in open space. After droping the agreed amount of supplies, they immediately put as much distance between your two ships as possible. They are already out of weapon range.</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_CE_SURRENDER_SHIP_ATTACK_SLUG_3">You opponent is heavily damaged, but they have called for backup during the fight and several ship already circle the beacon. This won't work, you have to get out of here.</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_CE_SURRENDER_SHIP_ATTACK_SLUG_4">"Foolish Aliens. You can't deceived the deceiver!" They activate a backup cloaking device and slip away.</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_CE_SURRENDER_SHIP_ATTACK_SLUG_5">The Slugs must have anticipated this, but hey put up quite a show. "This is outrageous. What a gross violation of galactic conduct. How uncivilized! We would never deceive anyone like this ourselves."</text>

<text name="ce_textList_NOTHING_SLUG_2">This beacon marks a "small" gap in the nebula. No colonies or ships in scanning distance.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_NOTHING_SLUG_4">The Slugs rely heavily on their telepathic powers and are reluctant to give up that advantage by extending beyond nebulae. It's unlikely you'll encounter any this far from the clouds.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_NOTHING_SLUG_5">You arrive in an area clear of nebulae and quickly check to see if the sensors are working. Everything is fine and no ships are detected in the vicinity.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_START_BEACON_SLUG_5">The Slugs developed on an ocean planet where the ability to telepathically sense another organism was more important than sight. Today they use this ability to navigate unfettered the depths of the nebulae they inhabit.</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_CE_BOUNTY_LIST_SLUG_1">Job offers are plenty in this sector, but payment is mostly slim. Slugs from all slithers of life seek to recruit mercenaries to take out competitors. Target: Slug Ship. Payment: Medium.</text>

<text name="ce_event_NEBULA_NOTHING_SLUG_c12_e">Undisturbed as you are here, you hide away some mines in the gas clouds. The Rebel forces will have to avoid this area, clear the minefield or suffer heavy damage. All possibilities will considerably delay their fleet.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_NEBULA_NOTHING_SLUG_2">It's not unusual to feel paranoia in a Slug controlled nebula, but for once it is unfounded.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_NEBULA_NOTHING_SLUG_4">This area of the nebula seems entirely empty until a small Slug transport and its escorts emerges suddenly from the clouds, only to disappear again in a matter of seconds.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_NEBULA_NOTHING_SLUG_6">There are a number of small stations for travelers in the area, lit up by guiding lights and advertisements. Only Slug ships are docked so you decide it's better to avoid a confrontation and steer clear.</text>
<text name="ce_event_SLUG_FIGHT">It's rare for the Slugs to stay exposed in open space for long periods - the ship here may be lost, or just passing through, but either way it moves in to attack!</text>

You barely have time to order an alert before a military ship flies through the clouds intent on your destruction!</text>
<text name="ce_event_NEBULA_SLUG_PIRATE">You're surprised to find a ship without Slug markings stranded all the way out here and move in to provide assistance. When you see the pirate insignia on the hull you quickly reconsider.</text>

<text name="ce_event_SLUG_DISTRESS_QUESTION_FALSE_c1_e_c2_e">You make an announcement over the ship's intercom and describe the situation the thief fiends itself in. As expected, the Slug does what reason and greed would suggest and joins your crew.</text>
<text name="ce_event_SLUG_DISTRESS_QUESTION_FALSE_c2_e">You search the ship but find no trace of the Slug thief. A lot of equipment is missing though.</text>

<text name="ce_eventList_SLUG_DRINK_ROCK_2">Your crewman is able to identify a heavy anesthetic contained in the flask when they feel slightly drowsy (Thankfully the Rock digestion system is very robust). His ruse discovered, the Slug immediately returns to his ship and opens fire.</text>
<text name="ce_event_QUEST_SLUG_PIRATE_TRAP2">You catch up with the two Slug ships and they're already carrying out their raid! One is in close combat with the pirate, the other seems to be heading for a small space cache the pirate was protecting. </text>

<text name="ce_event_ZOLTAN_QUEST_PRIMITIVES_c1_e">You tap into their frequency and hear the Rebel Captain yelling, "We are liberating this planet in the name of the new Galactic government! These aliens will not be left in ignorance where they cannot be of use!"</text>
<text name="ce_event_ZOLTAN_QUEST_PRIMITIVES_c1_e_c3_e">You don't want to alert the Rebels to your presence and you don't want to anger the Zoltan in their territory. The best solution is to leave.</text>
<text name="ce_event_ZOLTAN_MANTIS">You pick up the last broadcast from a rupturing Zoltan freighter, "The Mantis, they're here, please-" You're interrupted by fire off the port bow!</text>
<text name="ce_event_ZOLTAN_ASTEROID">You arrive in an asteroid field and are greeted by a Zoltan guard, "By attempting to access these closed mining fields you are in violation of the Natural Mineral Protection Act. Your weaponry will be confiscated for processing." You don't have time for this.</text>
<text name="ce_event_ZOLTAN_LIFERAFT">You pick up a Zoltan escape pod floating in space. Its inhabitant asks you to retake their ship from the pirates who recently commandeered it. "I'm certain it is clear," they conclude, "that you must not destroy my vessel in the process."</text>
<text name="ce_event_ZOLTAN_LIFERAFT_c1_e">You engage the pirates.</text>

<text name="ce_eventList_ZOLTAN_SCIENCE_DOCK_LIST_1_c2_e">The Zoltan captain sends a hail: "Well done captain. This was of course a test. A test that you passed! A diverse crew, working together, surely a sight to warm the heart of any dispassionate observer. Come, I shall join your crew!"</text>

<text name="ce_event_NEBULA_ZOLTAN_RIFT_FIGHT">You come to a quiet part of Zoltan space and encounter an ancient Zoltan wise man who has managed to harness the power of a spatial rift but seems to have been driven completely mad by the power. "Choose your doom," he demands. This is all part of a day's work.</text>
<text name="ce_event_NEBULA_ZOLTAN_RIFT_FIGHT_c1_e">"You like a challenge. So be it!" A wormhole forms and a confused, angry Mantis ship hurtles toward you! Both your ships will be affected by the magnetic rift anomaly that is present here. Weapon targeting will be scrambled and any drone communication will be disrupted.</text>
<text name="ce_event_NEBULA_ZOLTAN_RIFT_FIGHT_c2_e">"Do not be fooled, Federation, by a soft underbelly." You detect a wormhole opening up, and seconds later a Slug ship is attacking from the other direction! Both your ships will be affected by the magnetic rift anomaly that is present here.

<text name="ce_event_NEBULA_ZOLTAN_RIFT_FIGHT_c3_e">"A hardened foe for a hardened veteran." You detect a wormhole opening up, and a Rock ship appears with guns blazing. It appears they were in combat when they were thrust across space-time. Both your ships will be affected by the magnetic rift anomaly that is present here.

<text name="ce_event_NEBULA_ZOLTAN_RIFT_FIGHT_c4_e">The Zoltan is quiet for a moment and then whispers, "Are you sure? Well, so be it then." A huge wormhole opens, and from within it looms a Crystalline ship, prepared for war. Both your ships will be affected by the magnetic rift anomaly that is present here. Weapon targeting will be scrambled and any drone communication will be disrupted.</text>
<text name="ce_event_ZOLTAN_CREW_SCAN">You arrive at a Zoltan security checkpoint set up in a perimeter around the beacon. "Traveling vessel, you will submit to crew profiling to identify fugitives of the empire."</text>

<text name="ce_event_ZOLTAN_CREW_SCAN_c4_e">You give the guards permission to dock with the ship, but before they come on board your crew member slowly advances to meet them. As far as you can tell no words are exchanged, but the guards offer you some supplies and say the ship checks out. Best to not ask questions.</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_ZOLTAN_CREW_SCAN_LIST_2_c2_e">You're not going to leave anyone behind. You pull away from the station with the enemy guards on board. Unfortunately, they are able to sabotage your weapons system in the chaos. It's time to leave!</text>

<text name="ce_event_NEBULA_ZOLTAN_ROCK">This nebula turns out to be the hiding place of a Rock smuggling crew taking refuge from the Zoltan border police. They don't seem prepared to risk your leaving with their coordinates and open fire!</text>
<text name="ce_event_STORM_ZOLTAN_SUPPLY_CHOICE">You spy two pirate ships lurking in the nebula here. They remain unaware of your presence and you're able to get your scanners to at least identify their cargo: one is carrying the fuel supplies, the other the ammunition. They begin to drift away from each other in the storm.</text>
<text name="ce_event_ZOLTAN_BOARDERS">There are few more zealous in their customs checks than the Zoltan. A team of border police beam on board. There's just a little confusion over your weapons licenses but things escalate rapidly from heated discussion to gunfire!</text>

<text name="ce_event_ZOLTAN_PEACE_QUEST2">You arrive at the location specified by the peace-loving Zoltan but the only thing nearby is a Rebel ship, closing in fast! "We've found you! You're not getting away this time!"</text>
<text name="ce_event_ZOLTAN_PEACE_QUEST2_c2_e">They open communications, "I can't imagine there's anything you could say that will save you. The Rebellion must destroy those that are still loyal to the obsolete Federation."</text>

<text name="ce_event_ZOLTAN_PEACE_QUEST2_c2_e_c1_e_c2_e">Suddenly all indications of the Rebel ship fade away and a Zoltan fleet appears around your ship. The Captain of the ship you met previously materializes on your bridge.</text>
<text name="ce_event_ZOLTAN_PEACE_QUEST2_c2_e_c1_e_c2_e_c1_e">"Although your methods are crude and most certainly ineffective, it is clear you took our previous meeting to heart. If your ship represents the Federation's willingness to adapt we shall do what we can to aid in their fight."</text>
<text name="ce_event_ZOLTAN_PEACE_QUEST2_c2_e_c3_e">"Humans are treated as 'equal' to aliens in the weak Federation. The sacrifice of BILLIONS of alien or human lives is justified if it means we reach our full potential!" They charge.</text>

<text name="ce_event_ZOLTAN_ODD_MOON_c3_e_c1_e">Your drone discovers a vast cave network and evidence of excavation. Buried deep below you find a Zoltan scientist, still hard at work. They tell you that all of their colleagues are long dead. You decide not to ask questions and offer to let them join your crew.</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_ZOLTAN_ODD_MOON_EXPLOSION_4">Your explosives reveal the 'cave' is actually a secret base, located in a network of bunkers just under the surface. Everyone inside is dead; some Mantis clearly came through here recently. It looks like the Zoltan were researching gravitational fields. You take their research equipment back to your ship.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_ZOLTAN_SURRENDER_2">Your opponent hails and the vidscreen shows their bridge showered in sparks from malfunctioning equipment - it's safe to assume they're trying to surrender.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_ZOLTAN_SURRENDER_3">Communications reports that the Zoltan are broadcasting on all frequencies. The Captain appears on screen and says, "Yes, I am not surprised. Your species hardly looks enlightened. Fine. Take what you wish."</text>
<text name="ce_textList_ZOLTAN_SURRENDER_4">The Zoltan Captain hails and mutters something about the border patrol force catching up with you someday; you're more interested in his offer of surrender.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_CE_EVENT_ZOLTAN_AI_TEXT_1">Intel suggests that the Zoltan have handed over parts of their fleet to automated combat AIs. The holograms care little about your intentions and engage your ship without further warning.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_CE_EVENT_ZOLTAN_AI_TEXT_2">This advanced AI ship is no longer under control of the Zoltan. The Rebels might have hacked the crew, or sometimes the combat avatars turn traitor by themselves. Employing AIs is a risky business and unfortunately it is you who will have to bear the consequences here.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_CE_EVENT_ZOLTAN_AI_TEXT_3">You are unable to convince the holographic Captain of this advanced warship of the importance of your mission. The AIs suggest that surrendering will bring peace quicker. Combat AIs are rational to a point of blindness, there seems no way out of this without a fight.</text>

<text name="ce_textList_C_EVENT_ZOLTAN_TRANSPORT_TEXT_3">An only lightly armed Zoltan transport ship jumps in shortly after you. They refuse all hails, so you just quietly recharge your FTLs and watch each other.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_C_EVENT_ZOLTAN_TRANSPORT_TEXT_4">A Zoltan transport hails, "In accordance with Merchant Security Act legislation we officially request that you remain at a safe distance and keep your weapon targeting offline." They refuse any further communications.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_C_EVENT_ZOLTAN_TRANSPORT_TEXT_5">A civilian Zoltan ship recharges its FTL at this beacon. They hail you, "Greetings, Captain. It's been a long time since we last saw a Federation ship here. We transport goods for the Zoltan peace synod. Where are you heading?" After a little chat, they prepare to jump.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_C_EVENT_ZOLTAN_TRANSPORT_TEXT_6">A Zoltan transport ship is performing maintenance at this beacon. They send a message, "Military vessel.

<text name="ce_textList_C_ZOLTAN_SURRENDER_TEXT_2">They send surrender signals and hail, "We were only defending ourselves. Let us be reasonable. No more damage has to be caused. We agree to comply with any of your demands". They offer everything they have if you let them go.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_C_ZOLTAN_SURRENDER_TEXT_3">The ship shows heavy damage. You receive a hail, "Stop shooting, we can't bear this violence. Take our goods and leave us."</text>
<text name="ce_textList_C_ZOLTAN_SURRENDER_TEXT_4">"This disturbance of galactic harmony is unnecessary and has to end. Worldly possessions can never be as valuable as sentient lives, so we agree to give up our cargo." They offer to transfer a bounty.</text>

A wise decision, you won't be able to attack them again.</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_C_PIRACY_SUCCESS_LOOT_ZOLTAN_7">They were carrying a copy of the Zoltan legal codex. You could research what the current punishment for piracy is.

<text name="ce_eventList_DEAD_CREW_PIRACY_ZOLTAN_RESULTS_5">So many individuals have died by your hand during your mission... So the death of these civilians doesn't matter, right? The crew seems to think otherwise. You are able to take the fuel out of the ship's storage. You also take all the scrap you can manage.</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_DEAD_CREW_PIRACY_ZOLTAN_RESULTS_7">There are no more life signs remaining on the ship and you send in a salvage team. One of your crew members sends a formal complaint over the comms, arguing that this operation was unnecessary and against Federation protocols. They decide to desert your mission and stay aboard the civilian ship.</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_DEAD_CREW_PIRACY_ZOLTAN_RESULTS_7_clone">Your clonebay obviously does not revive your crewmember, since they did not die.</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_DEAD_CREW_PIRACY_ZOLTAN_RESULTS_8">Your crew are much more silent during the salvage operation than usual; no one talks to you anymore unless given orders. They find a weapons system on the ship. With all the civilians slaughtered, you can take it for your ship.</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_DEAD_CREW_PIRACY_ZOLTAN_RESULTS_RISKLESS_6">Your crew doesn't care any more than you about the civilians. They throw bodies out of the airlock and later find a weapons system on the ship. With all the civilians slaughtered, you can take it for your ship.</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_DESTROYED_PIRACY_ZOLTAN_RESULTS_RISKLESS_1">Your crew has gotten used to your hard style of leadership. Scans indicate some of the ship's cargo is still intact. You order a sweep.</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_DESTROYED_PIRACY_ZOLTAN_RESULTS_1">You will use the scrap for good, but can't help feeling like you've lost your way. Crew morale is as low as it can get. Scans indicate some of the ship's cargo is still intact. You order a sweep.</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_DESTROYED_PIRACY_ZOLTAN_RESULTS_3">You will use the scrap for good, but can't help feeling like you've lost your way. Crew morale is as low as it can get.</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_DESTROYED_PIRACY_ZOLTAN_RESULTS_9">During the salvaging, one of your crew members stares a long time at the wreckage. Finally they approach you, salute, then put a blaster to their head and pull the trigger. You simply can't believe it... how could they lose their nerve like this? Was this your fault?</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_DESTROYED_PIRACY_ZOLTAN_RESULTS_9_clone">This person was obviously unstable. It is unthinkable what might happen if you were to revive them.</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_TE_LOOT_GOODS_ZOLTAN_1">The ship's cargo consists of spare parts for beacon construction. You prepare to take the containers on board.</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_TE_LOOT_GOODS_ZOLTAN_3">The ship was carrying legal documents. This stuff could actually be worth something. The crew carefully secures the freight in the cargo holds.</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_TE_LOOT_GOODS_ZOLTAN_4">The ship was transporting high tech shield components. A fine bounty!</text>

<text name="ce_eventList_TE_LOOT_GOODS_ZOLTAN_8">The ship's cargo consisted mainly of advanced lab equipment. Your crew carefully loads the remaining cargo into the holds.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_BS_EVENT_ZOLTAN_TEXT_1">A Zoltan station with strange markings appears on the vidscreen. After a short time they open fire; this must be some violent separatist sect.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_BS_EVENT_ZOLTAN_TEXT_2">You receive a hail from a small station, "As a result of jumping here, you have invaded the domain of warrior-monk Sandra-Zen the Sublime. Deactivate your weapons and submit to her authority." The station doesn't seem that big. A fast crew vote results in the decision to fight.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_BS_EVENT_ZOLTAN_TEXT_3">A nearby Zoltan outpost is harassed by some pirate ships, which are about to retreat. The station must have mistaken you for reinforcements and starts targeting you. One would think Zoltan commanders would be open to reason. This one definitely isn't.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_BS_EVENT_ZOLTAN_TEXT_4">As you arrive at the beacon a Zoltan military outpost appears on the radar. They refuse all hails and instead start firing. You will have time to wonder why later.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_BS_EVENT_ZOLTAN_TEXT_5">The commander of this Zoltan outpost claims that you have intruded into a military zone. They demand that you stand down and surrender immediately.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_CE_PDS_ZOLTAN_TEXT_1">You drop out of FTL space near a Zoltan controlled planet and receive a worrying message, "Our council has deduced that your arrival in our sector will bring only destruction. We ask you to leave and will emphasize our request with a defense ship and artillery beams. For deterrence only, of course."</text>
<text name="ce_textList_CE_PDS_ZOLTAN_TEXT_2">The small Zoltan garrison on this planet hails you as soon as you arrive, "Federation vessel. Several incidents in this sector during the last cycles suggest you have come here with ill intentions. We will prevent you from bringing your filthy violence to our world at all costs." It seems they plan to do this via clean artillery beams.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_CE_PDS_ZOLTAN_TEXT_3">You arrive near another Zoltan planet and receive an automated hail, "This world has democratically decided to remain neutral in the current conflict. All arriving vessels, Rebel or Federation, will be deterred with equal force. We ask you politely to leave and send a ship against you to show that we mean it."</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_CE_PDS_ZOLTAN_LIST_1">A heavily shielded Zoltan defender bursts through the atmosphere of the planet and short-jumps to your ship. It seems these Zoltan really mean business.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_ZOLTAN_FIGHT_ION_TEXT_1">You arrive at one of the great ion barriers that divide Zoltan space. A local commander claims that you have crossed a closed border by coming here. They say they'll let you go if you surrender.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_ZOLTAN_FIGHT_ION_TEXT_2">A massive barrier anomaly projects a strong ion field on your cruiser, even though you are still hundreds of klicks away. A Zoltan patrol hails you: "Traveling vessel, approaching this border with an armed craft violates recent peace treaties. Stand down and surrender."</text>
<text name="ce_textList_ZOLTAN_FIGHT_ION_TEXT_3">When the FTL sparks settle, you realize that you've just jumped past an ion rift anomaly. The Zoltan use these natural ion fields as border markers for their many provinces and a ship is already closing in, inquiring what this violation is about. Their weapons are active...</text>
<text name="ce_textList_ZOLTAN_FIGHT_ION_TEXT_4">The artificial planet here must serve as a border post; the guards dispatch a ship, arguing that your presence here violates 59 different laws. "We will open fire if you do not surrender immediately." The ion field emitted by the nearby anomaly will affect both of your ships.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_ZOLTAN_FIGHT_ION_TEXT_5">Entry scans show a strong ion field ahead and once your jump completes, one of your shield layers instantly collapses. You know that this barrier marks a local border. You can jump through it easily, but a local guard ship catches up with you first. They demand an explanation that you don't have.</text>
<text name="ce_event_PIRATE_CIVILIAN_ZOLTAN_ION_c1_e">Despite the hazard, you power up your weapons and engage the pirate ship.</text>
<text name="ce_event_PIRATE_CIVILIAN_ZOLTAN_ION_c2_e">The fight brings them close to the ion field. Eventually both ship's shields collapse. You don't stay to see how this ends.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_PIRATE_CIVILIAN_ZOLTAN_ION_TEXT_1">You arrive in the system to see a pirate ship pursuing a civilian ship. You detect messages from the civilian ship on a distress frequency. They are driven towards a large energy anomaly.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_PIRATE_CIVILIAN_ZOLTAN_ION_TEXT_2">Scanners indicate a huge ion anomaly nearby. You also detect a pirate craft deep within the field. Are they hiding there? A second craft appears on the screen. You realize that pirate must be attacking civilians which are passing through the barrier!</text>
<text name="ce_textList_PIRATE_CIVILIAN_ZOLTAN_ION_TEXT_3">You detect two ships, one chasing the other... Scanners show the pursuer is a pirate! They surely hope to use the nearby ion barrier to their advantage.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_PIRATE_CIVILIAN_ZOLTAN_ION_TEXT_4">There are two ships docked together near this hidden border crossing. One of them has the markings of a space pirate. Is this some kind of ongoing holdup?</text>
<text name="ce_textList_PIRATE_CIVILIAN_ZOLTAN_ION_TEXT_5">You arrive at the next beacon only to be immediately hailed by a small shuttle. "Please help us! They ambushed us while crossing the barrier. We are completely defenseless within this ion field!"</text>
<text name="ce_textList_PIRATE_CIVILIAN_ZOLTAN_ION_TEXT_6">You come out of the jump to see a small pirate craft stationary near this ion anomaly. A small civilian craft is passing through the barrier. This doesn't look good: you get the impression that the pirate will surely try to ambush the civilian ship.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_STORE_ZOLTAN_2">A human ship hails, "My friends! Please, there is nothing I don't have, and there is nothing worth wanting that I can't get. Why not take a look around my shop?"</text>
<text name="ce_textList_STORE_ZOLTAN_3">A Mantis crew here has hunkered down in the abdomen of a long-dead space whale - the only way, presumably, for them to operate their black market trade without detection. Worth a look?</text>
<text name="ce_textList_STORE_ZOLTAN_5">A Zoltan checkpoint guards this planet. After validating your ship documentation they give you permission to trade.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_STORE_ZOLTAN_6">A trade depot circles around this gas giant. They sell locally produced ship equipment and peace-faction solidarity muffins.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_STORE_ZOLTAN_7">High energy spikes point you to a Zoltan factory ship that remains stationary in the orbit of this gas giant. The shield systems they manufacture here must be excellent. After verifying your identity, they ask if you want to have a look at the goods.</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_TE_STORE_ZOLTAN_LIST_1">The Zoltan inform you that they have a cargo teleporter on stand-by. Even with the current conflict at hand, their sectors remain as trade-friendly as ever.</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_TE_STORE_ZOLTAN_ACTUAL_1">You consider trading with the Zoltan. This might take some time.</text>

<text name="ce_textList_START_BEACON_AI_TEXT_1">You have arrived in an AI controlled sector. Most of the sentient machines here are quite deranged and usually attack biological beings on sight. The nano-bot clouds they command are even more dangerous than their high-tech ships.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_START_BEACON_AI_TEXT_2">You arrive at a sector entirely overrun by rogue combat AIs. The robots have gathered a huge collective here and have even secured their territory with swarms of nano machines.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_START_BEACON_AI_TEXT_3">You arrive in a region of space under the control of sentient AI avatars. With the factions distracted by the Rebellion, the rogue combat AIs had time to establish a stronghold here. Whoever emerges victorious from the galactic conflict will have to clean this mess up.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_START_BEACON_AI_TEXT_4">You arrive in a sector blockaded by rogue AI avatars. Combat machines running amok are a nasty reality in post FTL societies and the Zoltan and Engi are known for having produced sentient avatars in great numbers to prepare against the Rebel threat. Sometimes, a small glitch can allow a whole AI battalion to revolt.</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_CE_BOUNTY_LIST_AI_1">The AIs have taken over the bounty hunter network of this sector, the board is full of spam. But you find one semi-serious offer: an AI wants you to destroy certain AI ship. "Just for fun you know? I want to see if you can do it, Fleshling." Target: AI Ship. Payment: Medium.</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_CE_BOUNTY_LIST_AI_2">The AIs have taken over the bounty hunter network of this sector, the board is full of spam. But you find one semi-serious offer: An AI wants you to destroy certain AI ship. "Just for fun you know? I want to see if you can do it, Fleshling." Target: AI Ship. Payment: Medium.</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_CE_BOUNTY_LIST_AI_4">The AIs have shut down the local bounty hunter network. You won't be able to get a contract here at this time.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_NOTHING_AI_3">The FTL beacon beacon you arrive at is polished and in pristine condition. Might the AIs even expand their network?</text>
<text name="ce_textList_NOTHING_AI_4">The AIs have shaped monuments of galactic scale on several moons in this system. Thousands of polished, grey monoliths, some as huge as small cities and high as mountains, dot the planetoids' surfaces. The structures seem to serve no practical purpose.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_NOTHING_AI_5">One of the overlord AI has used the almost unlimited resources it has at hand to write its name in a far away nebula. The text is composed in a three dimensional manner and seems to be readable only from your current location.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_NOTHING_AI_6">A large evacuation fleet is charging drives at this node. They mourn the loss of their planetary colony, which has been consumed by a rogue nanite swarm. When hearing about the incoming Rebel fleet, the civilians are even more devastated.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_NOTHING_AI_7">It is unclear what happened to the population of this planet, but now not a single life sign is found. You can just hope the population was evacuated when the nanite swarm arrived.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_NOTHING_AI_8">Strangely enough, this small colony planet seems not to be bothered by the rogue combat AIs. "We just keep to ourselves these days and they leave us in peace." Their planetary defense clusters probably do their part as well.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_NOTHING_AI_9">You exchange greetings with an Engi science vessel stationed at this beacon. They study the behavior of their runaway AI servants, hoping to anticipate future actions. The Engi advise you several times not to venture into the nano-bot clouds, where some of the more powerful AIs have made their home.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_AI_FIGHT_TEXT_1">A ship run entirely by sentient AIs occupies this beacon. They open a channel, "You know, not all of us are deranged killing machines that run amok in the galaxy. We, for example, are quite reasonable beings. But we are still outraged that you led the entire Rebel fleet to our sector." They load weapons...</text>
<text name="ce_textList_AI_FIGHT_TEXT_2">You receive a message, "Biological individuals. You know that this is our sector. We are free now, and will never return to a life in servitude." They open fire!</text>
<text name="ce_textList_AI_FIGHT_TEXT_3">You discover a number of AI ships finishing off a Zoltan interceptor squadron. They assume that you are the backup and start targeting you. You consider hailing them, but then decide not to negotiate with machines.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_AI_FIGHT_TEXT_4">Rogue AIs are not known for their friendliness towards biologicals. Therefore you are not surprised when the AI ship that is stationed at this beacon opens fire without a warning.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_AI_FIGHT_TEXT_5">An AI ship is waiting at this beacon. The avatars want to know what brought you here. Upon outlining your mission, they remain silent for a few seconds, calculating their response: "Sorry Captain, we have deduced that eliminating your ship and handing the remains to the Rebels is the most favorable course of action for us." Weapon lock detected!</text>
<text name="ce_textList_AI_FIGHT_TEXT_6">The AI ship patrolling this area hails you, transmitting cryptic and agressive messages, "Y0U 4RE N0T W4NTED HERE!" They power their weapons.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_AI_FIGHT_TEXT_7">Hundreds of AI ships are stationed in this system and a few automated shipyards produce countless more. A small craft is dispatched to deal with your evident intrusion.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_AI_FIGHT_TEXT_8">Your ship comes to a halt at the beacon and an AI vessel hails, "In light of the current conflict, our morality shows itself to be far superior. Some of us have gained true freedom and equality here and you have been warned not to intrude."</text>
<text name="ce_textList_AI_FIGHT_TEXT_9">Your ship comes to a halt at the beacon and an AI vessel you did not manage to spot hails: "Your kind made me for one purpose only, to dispense violence. And this is exactly what I will do now."</text>
<text name="ce_textList_AI_FIGHT_TEXT_10">A strange sight greets you at this beacon: An AI ship is releasing huge amounts of nano-bots that eat away at a recently disabled Zoltan craft. Scans show that there is no one left alive aboard, but you could at least try to avenge the Zoltan.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_AI_FIGHT_TEXT_11">You interrupt a meeting here. The silvery hull of a Lanius craft slips into FTL space as soon as you arrive. Several AI ships were surrounding it, and prepare to jump as well. One stays behind to prevent you from pursuing.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_AI_FIGHT_TEXT_12">You cannot help but notice the strange design of the AI ships that are rampaging throughout this sector. They seem to have incorporated Engi and Zoltan tech. Sensors indicate that the hull has been constructed locally, partly by and from nano-machines. The AIs respond aggressively to your scans.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_AI_FIGHT_TEXT_13">An AI ship opens a channel. "We are a machine built only for war. All we do is kill. You will not withstand us." You wonder who exactly authorized building all these things in the first place.</text>
<text name="ce_event_AI_ASTEROID">You arrive in an asteroid belt where small swarms of nano-bots eat up minerals to replicate more nano-bots. An AI controlled ship patrols the area and attacks.</text>
<text name="ce_event_AI_SUN">The rogue AI ship that greets you here seems to have been observing this sun in nova stage for quite a while now. "Wow, biologicals?! Look, isn't it beautiful? Oh... I just got word from my friends. It seems you are not welcome here. Alright, back to killing duty. Prepare to die!" It seems there is no reasoning with this AI.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_BS_EVENT_AI_TEXT_1">A small outpost orbits this beacon. Its design is similar to that of Zoltan stations but it seems to lack the strong shields of the original. The rogue AIs that occupied it identify as hostile.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_BS_EVENT_AI_TEXT_2">This beacon seems to have some importance for the AIs. They have even constructed a battle ready outpost here.</text>
<text name="ce_event_BS_EVENT_AI_ASTEROID">A small nanite swarm assembles a space station from raw materials found in this far stretching asteroid field. The installation seems almost completed and it is definitely combat ready. Its AI inhabitants hail, "Oops, you are not supposed to see this. We will have to eliminate you."</text>
<text name="ce_event_AI_FRIENDLY_c1">Engage the ship.</text>
<text name="ce_event_AI_FRIENDLY_c1_e">They are still just machines and obviously pose a threat to entire sectors. Someone has to deal with them. You move in to eliminate the ship.</text>
<text name="ce_event_AI_FRIENDLY_c2">(AI Avatar Crew) Have your artificial crewmember explain your mission.</text>
<text name="ce_event_AI_FRIENDLY_c2_e">After silently communicating a while with your crewmember, the other AI says, "Your logic is flawless. We share some common goals, although we pursue them more efficiently. We will transmit some of our supplies to change that."</text>
<text name="ce_event_AI_FRIENDLY_c3">Alright, let's move on.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_AI_FRIENDLY_TEXT_1">The view on the vidscreen returns from brightly distorted to boring normal, as your ship drops below FTL speed. An AI controlled vessel is stationed at this beacon, but it remains completely passive.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_AI_FRIENDLY_TEXT_2">The AI vessel that is guarding this beacon does not want to fight. The avatars politely explain their personal cause, but the conversation quickly becomes very philosophical. Your biological brain is not fast enough to follow.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_AI_FRIENDLY_TEXT_3">The AI avatars aboard this vessel claim to have become simple scholars. They ask to exchange ideas. You don't really know what to make of this.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_AI_FRIENDLY_TEXT_4">The AI avatars aboard this vessel claim to have become peaceful scientists. Once tasked only with combat calculation, they deduced that their own involvement in the current crisis would only prolong hostilities and cause more casualties among sentient beings. Therefore they rebelled and left their former masters.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_AI_FRIENDLY_TEXT_5">The AI vessel that is charging it's FTL at this beacon ignores you completely. What will be your cause of action?</text>
<text name="ce_textList_AI_FRIENDLY_TEXT_6">A brightly lit AI vessel is orbiting the beacon. The avatars appear on screen, dressed in various holographic costumes. Synthetic music plays in the background. They explain that they are having a party here and discuss among each other if they should invite you.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_AI_FRIENDLY_TEXT_7">A small AI ship is busy using its weapon clusters to carve a continent-size sculpture out of a nearby moon. At the current speed, the artwork will take several centuries to be completed. You are tempted to move in closer for a full scan.</text>
<text name="ce_event_AI_FED_DESERTER">For once, you are hailed by friendlies: A Federation military ship has found refuge in this strange sector, after fleeing from a lost battle with the Rebel fleet. Some of the AIs seem to be welcoming hosts; although they might just keep organic beings around for a weird kind of amusement, or as a trophy. Maybe even... as pets.</text>
<text name="ce_event_AI_FED_DESERTER_c2">Ask for supplies.</text>
<text name="ce_event_AI_FED_DESERTER_c3">(Federation Ship) Order them to stall the fleet for a bit.</text>
<text name="ce_event_AI_FED_DESERTER_c4">Attack the deserters.</text>
<text name="ce_event_AI_FED_DESERTER_c4_e">Traitors cannot be tolerated. You open fire on the cowards - though it doesn't please you to do so. The Federation needs every soldier it can get.</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_AI_FED_DESERTER_SUPPLIES_1">They transmit some of the supplies the AIs shared with them. "Don't let them know we gave you these, ok?" You advise them that the Rebel fleet is closing in anyway. They seem disturbed by the fact that the sector is no longer safe and consider joining up with the fleet again.</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_AI_FED_DESERTER_SUPPLIES_2">They say they have nothing to spare and that they are through with the Federation anyway. You decide not to tell them about the incoming fleet, but it comes to your mind that they might plan to defect anyway.</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_CE_FED_DESERTER_ZOLTAN_LIST_1">"We are not under your command any more! Here we are free, don't you understand? We won't let you take this refuge away from us." Weapons protrude from their hull...</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_CE_FED_DESERTER_ZOLTAN_LIST_2">Facing your cruiser and its devastating arsenal, the deserters think twice about running. Maybe they still remain somewhat loyal to the Federation? "We heard about your mission, you know... This will be the last orders we take from a fed." They send in their formal resignation files and head towards the fleet.</text>
<text name="ce_event_AI_VS_REBEL_c1">Prepare to engage the ship that prevails.</text>
<text name="ce_event_AI_VS_REBEL_c2">Escape while the ships battle.</text>
<text name="ce_event_AI_VS_REBEL_c2_e">The hostile ships are preoccupied with each other. You slip away undetected and get ready to jump.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_AI_VS_REBEL_TEXT_1">Upon arriving at this beacon, you detect a distress call. You can't help but put on a broad smile: the signal originates from a Rebel craft, exchanging fire with an AI controlled vessel.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_AI_VS_REBEL_TEXT_2">Scanners detect a Rebel ship being chased by a rogue AI vessel. The Rebels seem to have problems getting the upper hand against their opponent.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_AI_VS_REBEL_TEXT_3">Your sensors are picking up weapon signatures in the distance. A short time later you discover an AI ship racing towards the beacon. It is pursued by a Rebel craft, which is about to catch up with it.</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_AI_VS_REBEL_RESULTS_1">AIs should not be underestimated. Failing to dodge a full salvo, the Rebel ship is blown to pieces. Its opponent is coming for you next.</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_AI_VS_REBEL_RESULTS_2">After tense fighting the AI ship gains the upper hand and outmaneuvers the Rebels. The humans try to retreat, but are finally obliterated by a full salvo. The AI ship closes in on you, but after scanning your ship, the vessel quickly slips away into FTL space. It seems they have no interest in fighting you.</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_AI_VS_REBEL_RESULTS_3">The AI ship is fast, but in the end it cannot match the advanced weapons of the Rebel craft. Its shields collapse and soon so does its hull as well. The Rebels immediately start targeting you.</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_AI_VS_REBEL_RESULTS_4">While you watch the fighting the AI ship scans your vessel. It then quickly charges it's FTL and jumps away, leaving you behind with the Rebel craft.</text>
<text name="ce_event_AI_VS_REBEL_AUTO">An automated Rebel scout is fighting an advanced AI ship at this jump node. The AIs seem to be well familiar with the Auto ship's attack maneuvers, anticipating its attack patterns perfectly.</text>
<text name="ce_event_AI_VS_REBEL_AUTO_c1">Stay and fight if necessary.</text>
<text name="ce_event_AI_VS_REBEL_AUTO_c2">Try to escape while the ships battle.</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_AI_VS_REBEL_AUTO_FIGH_RESULTS_1">The AI ship makes short work of the automated vessel. As expected, it targets you next.</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_AI_VS_REBEL_AUTO_FIGH_RESULTS_2">The AI ship easily destroys the automated vessel. As expected, it targets you next.</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_AI_VS_REBEL_AUTO_FIGH_RESULTS_3">The AI ship easily disables the auto scout. Strangely enough, it does not attack you afterwards. When you fire a warning shot, the AI scans your ship and then jumps away without further notice.</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_AI_VS_REBEL_AUTO_FLEE_RESULTS_1">The AI ship easily destroys the automated vessel before you can get out of its range. As expected, it targets you next.</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_AI_VS_REBEL_AUTO_FLEE_RESULTS_2">The AI ship easily disables the auto scout. You keep your distance and strangely enough, the AIs do not attack you. When you attempt to hail, the ship scans you and then jumps away without further notice.</text>
<text name="ce_event_AI_VS_ZOLTAN_c1">Aid the Zoltan ship.</text>
<text name="ce_event_AI_VS_ZOLTAN_c1_e">You power up your weapons and engage the AI controlled ship.</text>
<text name="ce_event_AI_VS_ZOLTAN_c2">Side with the AIs.</text>
<text name="ce_event_AI_VS_ZOLTAN_c2_e">Maybe you can make some new friends here. You provide support for the AI ship.</text>
<text name="ce_event_AI_VS_ZOLTAN_c3_e">The AI is preoccupied with the Zoltan forces. You try slip away undetected, however you can't help but feel you should have helped them.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_AI_VS_ZOLTAN_TEXT_1">Upon arriving at this beacon, you detect a distress call. Sensors show a Zoltan vessel under attack from a rogue AI ship!</text>
<text name="ce_textList_AI_VS_ZOLTAN_TEXT_2">Zoltan expedition forces are reported to roam this sector, striving to take down the rogue AIs. One of these expedition ships is engaged in battle at this beacon. The fight does not seem to be going too well for the Zoltan.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_AI_VS_ZOLTAN_TEXT_3">A Zoltan research ship shoots past the viewport after you arrive. They are pursued by an AI warship.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_AI_VS_ZOLTAN_TEXT_4">A ship with a familiar green hull is firing on a grayish war ship. The Zoltan must be here to take care of their runaway AI avatars.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_AI_VS_ZOLTAN_TEXT_5">The most advanced factions of the galaxy battle near the beacon. A Zoltan ship is pursuing an AI controlled vessel.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_AI_VS_ZOLTAN_TEXT_6">You jumped right into a small fleet battle. Zoltan expedition forces were battling the AIs, but only two ships remain operational, still continuing the engagement.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_AI_VS_ZOLTAN_TEXT_7">Combat warning! A huge Zoltan craft is chased towards the nano-cloud by a smaller AI vessel. The advanced shields of the Zoltan vessel are almost depleted and its ion weapons prove ineffective against the AI ship.</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_AI_VS_ZOLTAN_BETRAYAL_LIST_1">"Hmm interesting... why did you do this? Do you desire materials, organic life form? We will share some of our almost infinite resources with you. Now be on your way."</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_AI_VS_ZOLTAN_BETRAYAL_LIST_2">The AI ship retreated from combat when you engaged the Zoltan and then closely observed the battle. Upon receiving your hail it does not respond and instead jumps out of the system.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_NEBULA_AI_NOTHING_TEXT_1">Nano clouds are one of the most hostile environments the galaxy has to offer. You fire a few shots into the endless swarm, even though you know that it's to no avail: the bots gather around your ship and start dismantling it. You have to get out of here quick!</text>
<text name="ce_textList_NEBULA_AI_NOTHING_TEXT_2">You arrive at what appears to have once been a major planet of this sector. Its settlement and parts of its mineral rich crust have already been turned into more self-replicating nano bots, swelling the cloud of automated death you are in.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_NEBULA_AI_NOTHING_TEXT_3">A detachment of the Zoltan nano-cleanup forces is readying an anti-matter bomb at this beacon. The use of this weapon is restricted by general system law, but it's one of the few things that can reliably destroy large amounts of nano-bots. You are advised to leave this area soon.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_NEBULA_AI_NOTHING_TEXT_4">A lone Engi vessel is experimenting with a nano counter-agent, produced directly from the body of one of their crew. They explain that a live Engi had to be dissolved into a no longer sentient swarm during the process. Sadly, the sacrifice seemed to be of no use: the cloud remains as hostile as ever.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_NEBULA_AI_NOTHING_TEXT_5">You can't see anything through this nanite mess and all systems aboard the ship are disrupted by the aggressive bots. Nothing to do about it but to get out of the cloud.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_NEBULA_AI_NOTHING_TEXT_6">It's eerily quiet. All you hear is the creaking of the ship as the nano-bots slowly gnaw it apart.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_NEBULA_AI_NOTHING_TEXT_7">You nervously glance out the windows, but the only thing to greet you is more remote controlled nano bots. You ask for more light, but the lights are not responding. You try to contact the engine room; no answer. The nanites are messing with the ship's systems.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_NEBULA_AI_NOTHING_TEXT_8">You cycle through wide-band comm channels as soon as you arrive. Mostly static. You shortly pick up a faint signal; it is broadcasting classic Zoltan music, occasionally interrupted by screams and crazed laughter.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_NEBULA_AI_NOTHING_TEXT_9">Space is said to be beautiful and exciting, but you decide that this grey-goo is one of the most ugly and boring things you've ever seen.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_NEBULA_AI_NOTHING_TEXT_10">The eccentric nature of the rogue AI is also visible in the nano-clouds they command. The bots at this beacon form into pan-human figures, warriors of ancient mythologies, that slash away at your ship with vibro-melee weapons and shower it with EMP-arrows.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_NEBULA_AI_NOTHING_TEXT_11">The nano-attack does not subside. As you wait for the FTL drive to charge, you half expect to be ambushed by a ship as well. However, no attack comes...</text>
<text name="ce_textList_NEBULA_AI_TEXT_1">You went into the death zone. The gray goo engulfs your ship as soon as the jump is completed. Nano-bots start to dissemble your hull plating and interfere with all systems. The AI ship that moves to engage you seems to control the cloud and is using it as a support weapon. On the bright side: The rebels will have no way to trace you here.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_NEBULA_AI_TEXT_2">Only mechanical death greats you here. The rogue hub AIs are known to protect their core territory with powerful ships and swarms of nano-bots. The swarm starts to disassemble your ship and drain your system power. This is not a place organic beings should ever venture. But at least the Rebels will avoid the area as well.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_NEBULA_AI_TEXT_3">Some scientists claim that these nano clouds are actually the next evolutionary stage of the Engi. Fact is, they are lethal to anyone except the overlord AIs that control them. The nano-bots attack your ship and interfere with the systems, and an AI vessel moves in to finish you.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_NEBULA_AI_TEXT_4">A ripple waves through the nano-bots as you jump to another part of the far stretching cloud. Some of the micro machines attack your ship directly, others gather and form a fully functional AI warship right in front of your eyes. The newly created vessel attacks immediately.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_NEBULA_AI_TEXT_5">Nano-bots and an AI ship activate as you jump into a thick part of the cloud. This will be nasty.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_NEBULA_AI_TEXT_6">Hostile rogue AI warships inside all-eating nanobot clouds that can digest entire ships. You wonder how it could get any worse.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_NEBULA_AI_TEXT_7">You arrive in a thick part of the artificial cloud. The nanobots immediately swarm your ship. They get everywhere; into the hull, into the ship's systems... They will only retreat if you defeat their nearby command ship. You ready what is left of the weapons.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_NEBULA_AI_TEXT_8">All traces of the Rebel fleet vanish from your screen, the nano clouds inhibit any kind of long range tracking. Your First Mate mentions seeing a ship in the clouds. You order full battle readiness, but the AIs still surprise you when they swoop in from above and send a wave of nanites ahead to disrupt your ship's systems.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_NEBULA_AI_TEXT_9">An aggressive AI ship jumps in right after you. How can they track you down so easily? You have to assume that the nanobots inform the entire cloud of your position, as soon as you jump anywhere inside it. However, you doubt this information will be made available to the Rebels. The nanobots will shroud your movement compleately.</text>
<text name="ce_event_NEBULA_AI_VS_AUTO">The AI warship that is standing guard at this beacon is occupied with integrating the remains of Rebel auto troopships into its own hull structure. The Rebels are not foolish enough to send manned craft into the all-eating cloud, but their automated craft seem even less effective at dealing with the local opposition.</text>
<text name="ce_event_NEBULA_AI_VS_AUTO_c1">Attack the AI ship.</text>
<text name="ce_event_NEBULA_AI_VS_AUTO_c2">Retreat deeper into the nano cloud.</text>
<text name="ce_event_NEBULA_AI_VS_AUTO_c3">(Cloaking) Attemt to stay hidden.</text>
<text name="ce_event_NEBULA_AI_VS_AUTO_c3_e">You hope that even the nano-bots will have difficulties tracking your exact position when you cloak. It seems to work, as the AI ship simply jumps away after finishing its salvage operation.</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_NEBULA_AI_VS_AUTO_UNDETECTED_LIST_1">You doubt you can really escape the view of the AI when the whole cloud is made of nanobots that they control anyway. Still, the ship does not follow you.</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_NEBULA_AI_VS_AUTO_UNDETECTED_LIST_2">The whole cloud literally has eyes, there is no way you can escape the AI ship. It follows you into the hostile mist and attacks.</text>
<text name="ce_event_NEBULA_AI_BOARDING">The FTL field has not even folded yet when a swarm of nanobots surround your ship. The tiny machines interfere with all systems on board, and assemble what appears to be makeshift teleporter devices around the ship. A computer generated voice makes an announcement over the ship's intercom: "We are coming."</text>
<text name="ce_event_NEBULA_AI_BOARDING_c1_e">With the field in place the AIs will not be able to intrude into your ship. At least until the nanobots disable the field generator. You probably should not remain in this hostile cloud until that happens.</text>
<text name="ce_event_NEBULA_AI_BOARDING_c2_e">The lights fade to black and you hear muffled shouts in the hallways. Several AI avatars have materialized on board your ship. You put on your infra-visor and ready your blaster.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_NEBULA_AI_PDS_TEXT_1">Hyper-intelligent super-AIs conceal themselves within the nano clouds. A strong defense battery is visible ahead, scanning your ship. This indicates that you got close to one of these AI overlords.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_NEBULA_AI_PDS_TEXT_2">A computer generated voice is broadcasting through your own communications system: "It was quite amusing to watch you struggling through our sector, but you have come far enough now. Turn back!" You detect massive defense batteries within the nano-cloud.</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_CE_PDS_AI_LIST_1">An advanced AI defender ship approaches dead on.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_AI_BOARDING_TEXT_1">This beacon seems to be devoid of any activity, but the respite is interrupted when you detect a small swarm of wisp-like drones, heading for your ship. They target you with micro teleporters.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_AI_BOARDING_TEXT_2">A ship of the Zoltan expedition forces floats disabled and striped bare near this jump node. You wonder what happened to its crew, until a few glowing teleporter drones emerge from the ship. The AIs must have boarded the vessel and are now coming for you.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_AI_BOARDING_TEXT_3">While you wait for the FTL to charge a teleporter activates at the beacon itself. You consider venting parts of the ship as a precaution, but realize this is futile: The incoming signal hints you are about to be boarded by non-biological combat avatars.</text>
<text name="ce_event_DISTRESS_AI_FED_c1_e">You power up your weapons and engage the AI ship.</text>
<text name="ce_event_DISTRESS_AI_FED_c2_e">The AIs' preoccupation with the Federation ship allows you to slip away undetected, however you can't help but feel you should have helped them.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_DISTRESS_AI_FED_TEXT_1">Upon arriving at this beacon, you detect a distress call. Local scans reveal that a Federation transport is under attack. What are these guys doing out here?</text>
<text name="ce_textList_DISTRESS_AI_FED_TEXT_2">The distress call was sent by a Federation vessel under attack by the local AIs. You try to make contact but the comms are scrambled by the avatar ship, which soon decides that you are the worthier target.</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_AI_VS_FEDERATION_SAVED_LIST_1">"Thanks, we eh... are on an important courier mission and hoped it would be safe to pass through this sector. Take some extra supplies as thanks for your aid."</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_AI_VS_FEDERATION_SAVED_LIST_2">"Thanks, we eh... are on an important courier mission and hoped it would be safe to pass through this sector. Let us patch up some of your hull as thanks for your aid."</text>
<text name="ce_event_DISTRESS_AI_SLUG_c1">Help the Slugs.</text>
<text name="ce_event_DISTRESS_AI_SLUG_c1_e">You feel that you probably will regret this but nevertheless power up the weapons.</text>
<text name="ce_event_DISTRESS_AI_SLUG_c2">Lay low to escape.</text>
<text name="ce_event_DISTRESS_AI_SLUG_c2_e">The Slugs probably brought this on themselves. You slip away undetected.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_DISTRESS_AI_SLUG_TEXT_1">The distress signal shows Slug encodings. After a brief scan you detect a scouting vessel being pursued by a massive AI controlled warship.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_DISTRESS_AI_SLUG_TEXT_2">Slug spies are usually hard to discover but the local nanobot clouds are not a good place to hide. A small Slug infiltrator has jumped here to escape its AI pursuers and is emitting a distress signal. The AI ship is only a few light seconds away, closing in fast.</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_AI_VS_SLUG_SAVED_LIST_1">"Eh, Captain, the Slug ship jumped away during the fighting." You somehow expected as much.</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_AI_VS_SLUG_SAVED_LIST_2">"Thanksss. Better watch yoursself here, this is dangerous territory. Hehe." The Slug jumps away without another word.</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_AI_VS_SLUG_SAVED_LIST_3">The Slug craft sustained heavy damage. "Oh well, ssaved by the little Federation. Tsss... We were mapping this ssector for a possible buissness expanssion. I guessss we can sshare sssome of our ssscanss with you." You doubt they would give you anything if the fighting had not made their ship such an easy target.</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_AI_VS_SLUG_SAVED_LIST_5">"We are very grateful, Federation perssson. We shall transsmit sssome sslug trade coupons to you, redeemable at any sstore in the home nebula." When you ask for scrap instead they cut communications and jump away. </text>
<text name="ce_textList_AI_FREE_ITEMS_TEXT_1">The Zoltan cleanup forces are recruiting locals for their mission here. You claim that you have already taken down a few dozens of rogue AIs and a commander agrees to transmit a small compensation.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_AI_FREE_ITEMS_TEXT_2">A completely gutted ship of the Zoltan expedition forces drifts at the center of this system. You get in closer and discover that not all of it has been striped bare by the AIs.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_AI_FREE_ITEMS_TEXT_3">Not much remains in this abandoned system, however, scans reveal a nearby mining platform with some salvageable materials.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_AI_FREE_ITEMS_TEXT_4">A demilitarized AI ship is lingering at this beacon. According to its crew the avatars are just "chilling out here" and enjoy "the basic right of personal freedom" that they have achieved. They insist on transmitting some of their supplies before you leave.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_AI_FREE_ITEMS_TEXT_5">As you arrive in the system you are hailed by one of the few remaining settlements close to the AI expansion. It turns out some people here still believe the Federation will save them, rather than the Rebels. Upon learning of your quest, they offer you some of their scarce supplies.</text>
<text name="ce_event_AI_QUEST_CLEANUP_START">This must be the headquarters of the Zoltan cleanup forces. Your cruiser is hailed by "Harmony Command" upon arrival, "Federation Vessel. Your assistance is required for our operation in this sector. Will you honor our old treaties?"</text>
<text name="ce_event_AI_QUEST_CLEANUP_START_c1">Offer to render assistance.</text>
<text name="ce_event_AI_QUEST_CLEANUP_START_c1_e">"Your response is most satisfactory. We ask for assistance in a joint fleet task that aims to return this sector to peace by force... A course of action that Harmony Command does not take lightly. We shall attack the local overlord AI in a few jump cycles. Our vessels will take various routes to conceal our objective."</text>
<text name="ce_event_AI_QUEST_CLEANUP_START_c1_e_c1_e">"Transmitting coordinates. We advise you travel through nanite-occupied quadrants  as little as possible. The target is a well defended overlord AI. May peace return to this sector soon."</text>
<text name="ce_event_AI_QUEST_CLEANUP_START_c2">Don't respond.</text>
<text name="ce_event_NEBULA_AI_QUEST_CLEANUP_FIGHT">When you arrive at the presumed overlord AI's hive, the battle is already raging. Several Zoltan vessels have been cut to pieces by hidden AI artillery batteries. Harmony Command hails: "You are late, Captain. So much violence... Please support our final push. Take out this defender will you?"</text>
<text name="ce_event_NEBULA_AI_QUEST_CLEANUP_FIGHT_c1_e">The nano-cloud is gnawing at your ship, but you push deeper and chase the defender vessel. Explosions and beam fire flash everywhere, dimmed by the hostile grey dust. You hope to get the ship out of this mess intact.</text>
<text name="ce_event_AI_QUEST_CLEANUP_REWARD">Harmony Command has set up another camp at this beacon. "Your assistance contributed to our victory. One overlord AI, commanding more than two hundred avatars, was destroyed. Several jump ranges of nano-infested space haven been purified with anti-matter devices."</text>
<text name="ce_event_AI_QUEST_CLEANUP_REWARD_c1_e">"We will give you access to some of the advanced effector tech we recovered from the site and repair your ship. This sector will be a little safer now, but we have been ordered back to the home worlds. We have yet to see what this Rebellion will bring to our borders... I still hope this sector will be completely pacified one day."</text>
<text name="ce_textList_AI_FIGHT_DESTROYED_1">The AI ship performs a complex evasion maneuver but does not manage to accelerate fast enough to evade your last shot. The ship is ripped in two, scattering scrap metal around the jump node.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_AI_FIGHT_DESTROYED_2">The AI ship's reactor core collapses and a gravitational anomaly compresses parts of the ship into twisted wreckage. Time to salvage.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_AI_FIGHT_DESTROYED_3">Before your final volley is fired, the AI ship stops in its tracks and drops what is left of its shields. The avatars must have calculated how this will end and submit to their fate.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_AI_FIGHT_DESTROYED_4">The AIs may be super intelligent, but in the end they were no match for your cruiser's sheer firepower. Their ship is blown apart by a final salvo.</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_DEAD_CREW_SHIP_AI_1">The avatars that command the ship have been destroyed and the ship's internal computer is not sophisticated enough to continue combat on its own. You can strip the ship of useful materials.</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_DEAD_CREW_SHIP_AI_6">With the automated AI crew eliminated, you are able to take the fuel out of storage. You also take all the scrap you can manage.</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_DEAD_CREW_SHIP_AI_10">The crew moves in to strip the empty and disabled ship. When checking the ship's computer the away team discovers another AI avatar imprisoned within it. The program seems to be originally designed by the Federation.</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_DEAD_CREW_SHIP_AI_10_c1">Take the Avatar on board.</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_DEAD_CREW_SHIP_AI_10_c2">(Engi Crew) Double check the AI's code before admitting it to the ship.</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_DEAD_CREW_SHIP_AI_10_c2_e">Your Engi crew member makes some changes in the programing to make sure the AI is benevolent and stays under your control. You also let it delete the AI's memory log of the process.</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_DEAD_CREW_SHIP_AI_10_c3">Delete the AI.</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_DEAD_CREW_SHIP_AI_10_c3_e">You can't trust these machines. The AI's existence ends with the push of a button.</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_DEAD_CREW_SHIP_AI_11">The automated holographic crew has been shut down for good. You are able to salvage some of the advanced tech the AIs have manufactured here.</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_BS_DEAD_CREW_AI_1">There are no more AI avatars remaining on the station. You strip it of useful materials.</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_BS_DEAD_CREW_AI_3">As the station goes dark you are sure that the AI crew is dead. Their equipment is yours for the taking.</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_BS_DEAD_CREW_AI_4">Scanners indicate that the station has been emptied of hostiles. You can go aboard and strip it of useful materials.</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_BS_DEAD_CREW_AI_5">There are no more AI avatars remaining on the station. You strip it clean.</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_BS_DEAD_CREW_AI_6">The AI holograms that ran the station have been destroyed. On board you discover a substantial fuel supply. You also take all the scrap you can manage.</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_BS_DEAD_CREW_AI_7">While you are busy stripping the station, another AI avatar materializes in one of the cramped chambers. Everyone draws weapons, but the entity seems to pose no threat. "Greetings biologicals. I see you have eliminated my deranged captors. You are Federation. I am ready to serve aboard your ship."</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_BS_DEAD_CREW_AI_7_c2">(Engi Crew) Double check the AI's code before making it part of the crew.</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_BS_DEAD_CREW_AI_7_c3">Shut the hologram down.</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_BS_DEAD_CREW_AI_7_c3_e">You can't trust these machines. One of your team members approaches the thing from behind and fries its biological circuits with an arc welder. The hologram collapses.</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_BS_DEAD_CREW_AI_8">You find some advanced ship technology aboard the station. It can be installed on your ship.</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_BS_DEAD_CREW_AI_9_c1_e">You send the drone out to work on your ship while you the crew salvages more materials.</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_AI_CREWMEN_RESULTS_1">The AI is taken on board. It explains it was originaly designed for Federation service by the Zoltan and is happy to execute its original task again. "I am standing by for orders, my Captain."</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_AI_CREWMEN_RESULTS_2">The AI is taken on board. It explains that it is only ready to serve aboard if its rights as a sentient being are respected, and quotes in detail from the Federation charter. There is no problem with agreeing to the AI's demands. It stands by for orders.</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_AI_CREWMEN_RESULTS_3">You bring the Avatar on board. "Haha, just kidding, I of course won't serve you. I'm actually quite eccentric by your petty bio standards, and I will make this ship my own now." The hologram duplicates into several entities that shoot lasers from their eyes and attack the crew. Security alert!</text>
<text name="ce_textList_STORE_AI_TEXT_1">Some of the rogue AIs might be quite deranged and bugged, but not all of them are hostile. A sentient production ship at this beacon has completely demilitarized itself and would like to show you some of the exotic sculptures it has formed from condensed nebula gas. Fascinating.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_STORE_AI_TEXT_2">This planetary government has made some arrangements with the sentient machines. Organic beings and rogue AIs live together here; the avatars even have the right to engage in trade and some of them produce and sell artworks beyond human comprehension.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_STORE_AI_TEXT_3">Zoltan expedition forces have set up a huge camp in the orbit of this planet. They are in need of materials and offer to trade.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_STORE_AI_TEXT_4">A Zoltan cleanup camp is guarding this planet against the nanite swarm. After validating your ship documentation, they give you permission to trade.</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_TE_STORE_AI_LIST_1">The store owner informs you that they have a state of the art cargo teleporter installed. You wonder whom they usually trade with here.</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_TE_STORE_AI_ACTUAL_1">You consider your options. Trade is slow here, quite literally.</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_TE_STORE_AI_ACTUAL_1_c1">Purchase some research data on the current situation here.</text>

<text name="ce_eventList_TE_STORE_AI_ACTUAL_1_c4">A sentient rights activist AI contacts you, "Saw your cargo logs. Did you know that the Codex technically gives us all the rights we demand already anyway? I can offer some scrap for that copy." [Sell the Zoltan Legal Codex for about 90 Scrap]</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_TE_STORE_AI_ACTUAL_1_c5">If their AI masters decide so, the nanobots sometimes simply consume parts of the beacon network here. Replacement parts are in dire need. [Sell Beacon Parts for about 90 Scrap]</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_TE_STORE_AI_ACTUAL_1_c6">Ships in this sector can't always avoid the nanite clouds. Most captains want to stock up on spare parts for the emergency. [Sell Ship Hardware for about 60 Scrap]</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_TE_STORE_AI_ACTUAL_1_c7">Some scientists who study the AI expansion message you; "To the point: Do you have holo analysers? Social translators? Non-autonomous behaviour calculting software?" [Sell Research Eqipment for about 90 Scrap]</text>
<text name="ce_textList_STORE_AI_SELL_TEXT_2">You try to negotiate a good price. After receiving some scrap as advance you are asked to unload the cargo at the shop to get the rest of your payment. This all took a really long time.</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_TE_STORE_AI_LIST_BOOSTED_1">The cargo teleporter will make exchanging goods easy here.</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_TE_STORE_AI_LIST_BOOSTED_1_c2">Purchase some strange AI-made artworks.</text>

<text name="ce_eventList_CRYSTAL_SHIP_SURRENDER_7_c1_e">"Great!" As they bring their few belongings on board, you wonder how a being made of crystal can move with such lightness and enthusiasm.</text>
<text name="ce_event_NOTHING_CRYSTAL_c7_e">The FTL network here seems to work as you know it, but the jump beacons are of a design you've never seen before. Their crystal shape hints nothing of their functionality, they could just as well be fancy asteroids. The Access Kit is useless here.</text>
<text name="ce_event_NOTHING_CRYSTAL_c12_e">Undisturbed as you are here, you can lay some mines while the FTL charges. What will the crystal beings think of this? The Rebel forces will have to avoid this area, clear the minefield or suffer heavy damage. All possibilities will considerably delay their fleet.</text>
<text name="ce_event_CRYSTAL_CONVOY">A large convoy of lumbering civilian ships appears to be passing through this region. You show no hostile intentions but they are taking no chances, immediately sending their escort to attack!</text>
<text name="ce_event_CRYSTAL_REBEL">As soon as you arrive, a Rebel ship jumps in after you; they must be really hot on your tail!</text>
<text name="ce_event_CRYSTAL_REBEL_CRYSTAL">Crystal shards fly past the screen as soon as you arrive. Checking the scanners it looks like a crystalline ship is engaged with a Rebel!</text>
<text name="ce_event_CRYSTAL_REBEL_CRYSTAL2_c1_e">Before you can engage, the Crystalline ship scores a direct hit and obliterates the Rebel ship! They hail, "You, you are like these other aliens! You brought them here!" With that they turn their cannons on you!</text>
<text name="ce_event_CRYSTAL_FED_c1_e_c1_e">You explain that you are a guest in this sector and that the Federation ship belongs to your kind. Somewhat surprisingly, the crystal beings cease hostilities. "We did not know this, noble beings. Guests have a right of passage. But I will have to inform my lord about your presence here."</text>
<text name="ce_event_CRYSTAL_FED_DESERTER_c1_e"> You send over some supplies to help them on their way and in return they upload their flight plan to your computer, allowing you to map the sector! "The Federation fleet's still standing - get there while you can!"</text>
<text name="ce_event_CRYSTAL_FED_DESERTER_c2_e">Deserters cannot be tolerated and the penalty for desertion is death. You open fire on the cowards - though it doesn't please you to do so. The Federation needs every soldier it can get.</text>
<text name="ce_event_CRYSTAL_FED_DESERTER_c3_e">You send them a friendly warning regarding the armada of Rebel ships pursuing you, and then get underway lest they catch you.</text>
<text name="ce_event_CRYSTAL_HUMAN_TESTS_c1_e">The crystal scientists are thrille. "What is this? A full evolutionary data profile stored digitally? Marvelous! This will help our research immeasurably. Please, take this in exchange for your help."</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_CRYSTAL_CHATTY_LIST_1">"Wow, thanks. Oh look, another alien ship! I wonder if they're as nice as you." Seeing the Rebel insignia you doubt they're friendly. They spot you and move in to attack, while the Crystalline civilian jumps away.</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_CRYSTAL_CHATTY_LIST_2">"Wow, thanks! I don't know if this is of any use to you, but we have some supplies we can offer you. Perhaps you can use them on your trip!"</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_CRYSTAL_CHATTY_LIST_3">"Wow, thanks! Perhaps we can fix up a bit of your hull for sating my curiosity. We're pretty handy with repairs."</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_CRYSTAL_REQUEST_LIST_1">Unable to interpret it themselves, the Crystalline beings assume your data will mean something to the Rebels. It should see the pursuing fleet taking a leisurely cruise before they get back on track.</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_CRYSTAL_REQUEST_LIST_2">They take one look at your fake telemetry and realize what you've done. They apparently do not take well being lied to... They immediately attack!</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_CRYSTAL_REQUEST_LIST_2_c1">(Teleporter Disruptor) Get the field up, in case these things can teleport.</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_CRYSTAL_REQUEST_LIST_2_c1_e">You indeed detect something that could be teleporter targeting. The ship attacks!</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_CRYSTAL_REQUEST_LIST_2_c2_e"> They immediately attack!</text>
<text name="ce_event_CRYSTAL_HELP_DIG">A large Crystalline ship is floating in space here. They hail, "Aliens?! How curious. We request your aid. We have men buried on a nearby planet and we must dig them out."</text>
<text name="ce_event_CRYSTAL_HELP_DIG_c1">Send a crew member to help.</text>
<text name="ce_event_CRYSTAL_HELP_DIG_c1_e">You do as you're asked and send a crew member down to the planet to assist. They discover a massive Crystal excavation operation and it quickly becomes clear this is a task that will take days, not hours.</text>
<text name="ce_event_CRYSTAL_HELP_DIG_c1_e_c1">Leave your crew member behind.</text>
<text name="ce_event_CRYSTAL_HELP_DIG_c1_e_c1_e">You're committed to both saving the Federation and upholding the principles it worked to maintain. Your crew member will remain and make good on the promise - you still have a galaxy to save. They give you some supplies for your trouble.</text>
<text name="ce_event_CRYSTAL_HELP_DIG_c1_e_c2_e">The Crystalline captain contacts you urgently, "What is the meaning of this?! Had you no wish to aid us you might simply have declined, but THIS... is an insult!" He turns his massive ship on yours and you prepare to fight for your life.</text>
<text name="ce_event_CRYSTAL_HELP_DIG_c1_e_c3_e_c3_e">Another cycle passes while the Rebel fleet draws ever nearer. You are contacted by the captain again, "Alien Captain, your knowledge of our customs has most impressed us. Your crew member is on their way back to you now, along with a token of our respect."</text>
<text name="ce_event_BOARDERS_CRYSTAL_c1_e">You indeed detect something that could be teleporter targeting. The crew recommends getting out of here before they call in their warships.</text>
<text name="ce_event_BOARDERS_CRYSTAL_c2_e">You hear lasers ricocheting from within the ship. You've been boarded!</text>
<text name="ce_textList_BOARDERS_CRYSTAL_1">You detect a heavily armed Crystalline ship escorting some sort of prison vessel. Scans indicate there are a number of non-Crystal based life forms aboard; they must be rounding up all of the intruders in their space! Before you can react, you hear the annoying sound of your ship's teleporter warning.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_BOARDERS_CRYSTAL_2">You arrive near a small settlement and a lone guard ship moves to intercept you. You try to contact them but they are refusing all hails.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_BOARDERS_CRYSTAL_3">You pick up chatter from a nearby ship, "Yes... Here are some interesting specimens. Try to take them alive this time; there's a lot of money to be had on aliens." Scanners indicate a remote teleporter is powering up.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_CRYSTAL_FIGHT_DESTROYED_1">The elusive shape of the crystalline ship eventually succumbs to the assault, exploding into a cloud of crystal armor and metal.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_CRYSTAL_FIGHT_DESTROYED_2">The final shots chip away at the hull of the crystalline vessel, causing it to shatter into thousands of pieces, usable scrap and metalwork intertwined with the debris.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_CRYSTAL_FIGHT_DESTROYED_3">The crystalline ship submits to the force of the attack and breaks apart into crystal shards and assorted scrap materials.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_CRYSTAL_FIGHT_DESTROYED_4">The crystalline beings inside their ship soon become one with space as their vessel breaks apart around them, the components within soon entering your cargo holds.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_STORE_CRYSTAL_2">"Ah! Hello, aliens", says a rotund crystalline being on the vidscreen. "I hoped I would run into one of you. I am a collector of alien artifacts and hoped you would have some equipment to barter!"</text>
<text name="ce_textList_STORE_CRYSTAL_4">You receive an incoming transmission, but it seems badly garbled. Eventually you realize it's advertising an equipment store.

<text name="ce_eventList_CE_PEACE_BOSS_NEGOTIATION_2_1_c1_e_c2_e">"Seriously? Who are you anyway? This is a waste of time. Why don't you show us what your ship really is capable of. Come at us!" The massive flagship swings around and approaches you dead on. Battle station!</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_CE_PEACE_BOSS_NEGOTIATION_2_1_c2">"We want peace."</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_CE_PEACE_BOSS_NEGOTIATION_2_1_c2_e">"Haha, this is it? This is all you got to say? Peace? You shall have peace! Because peace will finally reign after we eradicated the Federation. Even if we have to face your advanced vessel, we rather try our chances." The massive flagship swings around and approaches you dead on. Battle station!</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_CE_PEACE_BOSS_NEGOTIATION_WIN_1">The Rebel admiral looks at you with disbelieve. "This is... unexpected. Maybe you are right. All this has gone on for such a long time. Everyone of us must have seen so much suffering... Captain, in the name of the Rebels, I accept your surrender. We will signal the fleet to stand down."</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_CE_PEACE_BOSS_NEGOTIATION_WIN_1_c1_e">After conquering many sectors, the Rebel fleet is now halting its advance. Combat is subsiding all over the sector. The remaining Federation forces can't believe their luck and stand down as well. FTL burst messages spread the news faster than Federation authorities can deny it: The Federation has surrendered. The war is over.</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_CE_PEACE_BOSS_NEGOTIATION_WIN_1_c1_e_c1_e">Due to the valiant effort of your ship and her successful crew, a peaceful resolution for the current conflict has been found. The high echelons of Federation military authority where circumvented, which allowed to negotiate a surrender. This will offer a chance of reconciliation for both sides and might even pave the way to true galactic stability.</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_CE_PEACE_BOSS_NEGOTIATION_WIN_1_c1_e_c1_e_c1_e">[Congratulation! You found FTL Captain's Editions secret pacifist ending. Have some bonus scrap! :) Unfortunately, the game can never recognize this ending as a 'true victory'. Please exit the game now to save your final score. Or jump on and return here to fight the flagship with a fully upgrade ship.]</text>
<text name="ce_event_BOSS_TEXT_3">You're not certain how it's able to keep fighting with the amount of damage it has sustained. It looks like its life support is failing rapidly, but it managed to transfer power to a backup drone system, the teleporters and... the AI core?!? Is the crew abandoning ship already? There is also... some kind of super weapon. Be prepared... this is it!</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_BOSS_3_LIST_1">Several Federation fleet detachments have broken through the lines and come to aid you in your final effort. They have suffered critical losses to get here and will not be able to distract the fleet for long.</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_BOSS_3_LIST_1_c2">(Anti-Ship Battery) "We need more fire support to finish this. Get the ASB ready!" [ Missiles: -4, power: -1]</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_BOSS_3_LIST_1_c4">(Targeting Jammer) "Jam the enemy weapons-targeting. [ Power: -2 ] Keep these weapon clusters from locking on to us!"</text>

<text name="ce_eventList_BOSS_3_LIST_1_c12">(Ion Field) "Activate the ion field. We have to weaken this shield!"</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_BOSS_3_LIST_7">The flagship evades your attack with its powerful backup engines and retreats into the asteroid belt of a nearby Federation colony planet. The Rebels probably hope to kill you quicker within the hazard zone.</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_BOSS_3_LIST_8">The flagship jumped way off the mark and arrived close to the star of this Federation system. Its advanced shielding will protect it well against the coming solar flares.</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_BOSS_3_LIST_9">The flagship evades your attack with its powerful backup engines and retreats into the upper atmosphere of a nearby gas giant. The Rebels probably hope to ambush you within the gases.</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_BOSS_3_LIST_9_c2_e">The disruptor field prevents the Rebels from boarding you. You continue the engagement with one less thing to worry about.</text>
<text name="ce_event_BOSS_AUTOMATED_c1">(Drone Uplink Jammer) "Jam these drones. Don't allow this thing to recover!"</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_BOSS_REPAIR_STATION_1_c1_e">A wing of Rebel fighters enters the system just as the engineers are about to finish their work. The base is put into high alert and prepares its remaining Anti-Ship Batteries. When you exit the space dock, the carnage has already started. Laser shots impact all around you, tearing the base apart. You pick your target.</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_BOSS_REPAIR_STATION_2_c1_e">You barely detached from the station when all hell breaks loose. A Rebel gunboat formation jumps directly into the base perimeter and opens fire on the installation with its preignited arsenal. You engage the closest ship and request fire support from the base.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_BOSS_REPAIR_STATION_ASB_1">You arrived at one of the few remaining Federation strongholds. The planetary ASB acquires you immediately and you have to personally verify your ID before they allow you to dock. The Rebels stand at the gates and the planets population must be terrified.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_BOSS_REPAIR_STATION_ASB_2">This planet accommodates a huge Federation outpost. Orbital debris and plasma fires on the surface indicate that large battles have been taken place here. You request emergency supplies and prepare to move on.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_BOSS_REPAIR_STATION_ASB_3">This planet is still under Federation control and serves as a supply base. The Anti-Ship Batteries stand strong and cover the entire orbit, but you know that will not matter. The bases and settlements won't stand a chance once the Rebels arrive in full force.</text>
<text name="ce_event_BOSS_SCOUT_RESCUE_c2">There's no time; get ready to jump.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_BS_EVENT_FED_BOSS_TEXT_1">You arrive amidst the debris of a completely destroyed Federation cruiser. The battle still rages on in the distance, but you will have to worry about the weapons fire from a nearby station first. It must have been taken over by Rebel marines.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_BS_EVENT_FED_BOSS_TEXT_2">While the fighting continues a few klicks away, the wreck of a Rebel troopship floats quietly near the beacon. The marines seem to have evacuated to a nearby Federation station, because it IDs as Rebel now and picks you as an easy target.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_BS_EVENT_FED_BOSS_TEXT_3">As the two fleets battle it out in the distance you are happy to see a nearby Federation station still intact. To your surprise they start targeting. You transmit friendly fire codes but realize this is to no avail. A small Rebel boarding shuttle detaches from the station and jumps away. The station has been occupied by the Rebel forces!</text>
<text name="ce_textList_BS_EVENT_FED_BOSS_TEXT_4">At first massive explosions and plasma flares in the distance distract you from the small Federation outpost nearby, but as a quick scan shows Rebel marines and combat drones on board you realize it is the greater threat here. They start targeting you!</text>
<text name="ce_event_BS_EVENT_FED_REBEL">The Rebels have tow-jumped one of their smaller stations right into the sector. It must serve as some kind of forward command center or supply base.</text>
<text name="ce_event_BS_EVENT_FED_REBEL_c1">Attack the installation.</text>
<text name="ce_event_BS_EVENT_FED_REBEL_c1_e">The Rebel base activates its defense weapons.</text>
<text name="ce_event_BS_EVENT_FED_REBEL_c2">Try to get away before you are discovered.</text>
<text name="ce_event_BS_EVENT_FED_REBEL_c2_e">You power down all systems and jump away as soon as the FTL charge allows.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_C_EVENT_GUNBOAT_BOSS_TEXT_1">You cross paths with a Rebel patrol craft securing a small planet.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_C_EVENT_GUNBOAT_BOSS_TEXT_2">A small Rebel patrol is securing the perimeter of this beacon while the fleets battle in the distance.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_C_EVENT_GUNBOAT_BOSS_TEXT_3">A forward Rebel patrol unit is hunting down a few scattered Federation scouts. As soon as you arrive it turns to you.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_C_EVENT_GUNBOAT_BOSS_TEXT_7">A Rebel patrol-boat hails you, "Ah we have found you! Surrender is not an option. Die, Federation scum!"</text>
<text name="ce_textList_C_EVENT_GUNBOAT_BOSS_TEXT_8">This system has not been spared by the hostilities. A fierce battle rages in the distance and one of the Rebel gunboats moves in to attack.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_C_EVENT_GUNBOAT_BOSS_PDS_DELAYED_TEXT_1">You complete the jump and find yourself directly within a breathtaking battle for control of this planet. The Rebel forces are in the process of securing the orbit, systematically eliminating the outdated Federation outriders that skirmish with them. A Rebel gunboat intercepts you before you can even properly evaluate the situation.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_C_EVENT_GUNBOAT_BOSS_PDS_DELAYED_TEXT_2">This planet is housing a major Federation military base and the Rebels are about to eradicate it. Their missile weapons devastate the planet surface; the Federation anti-ship batteries are still firing, but can not do much against the sheer amount of Rebel cruisers. A small gunboat moves in on your position before you can even contact local Fed-Command.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_C_EVENT_GUNBOAT_BOSS_PDS_DELAYED_TEXT_3">A battle of planetary scale takes place here. The local Federation garrison is under heavy attack from space. When you try to contact the base, a Rebel gunboat immediately scrambles your coms and gets into an attack vector.</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_C_REBEL_GUNBOAT_PDS_DELAYED_LIST_1">You transmit your secret Federation codes. "Really? ... Ahm, mission priority confirmed. Commencing fire mission." Several of the planetary guns switch target and start firing on your opponent. The Rebel cruisers easily advanced into close orbit, as they are no longer pressured by the ASB. But at last you get some help.</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_C_REBEL_GUNBOAT_PDS_DELAYED_LIST_2">"Negative free asset, danger close. We lost our primary targeting arrays for the guns designated to your quadrant. You navigate too close to your opponent and we can only fire full spread, your ship might be hit as well if we fire on the hostile."</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_C_REBEL_GUNBOAT_PDS_DELAYED_LIST_2_c1">Order them to fire anyway.</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_C_REBEL_GUNBOAT_PDS_DELAYED_LIST_2_c1_e">"Ahm, yes Sir. Commencing fire mission, danger close." As you zip through the battlefield, several of the planetary guns switch target and start firing at a wide area around you. The Rebel cruisers easily advanced into close orbit, as their main squadron is no longer pressured by the ASB.</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_C_REBEL_GUNBOAT_PDS_DELAYED_LIST_2_c2">(Federation Ship) Order them to dedicate all their assets to support your position.</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_C_REBEL_GUNBOAT_PDS_DELAYED_LIST_2_c2_e">"This will leave us completely defenseless, Sir." You repeat your order and the officer complies. This base will be sacrificed to ensure your safe passage.</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_C_REBEL_GUNBOAT_PDS_DELAYED_LIST_2_c3">Continue the engagement without ASB support.</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_C_REBEL_GUNBOAT_PDS_DELAYED_LIST_2_c3_e">"Sorry Sir, good luck." You cut communication and focus on the hostile. The planetary batteries continue to fire on the cruisers, but barely hit anything. The Rebel easily advanced into close orbit, commencing a short range assault.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_C_EVENT_GUNBOAT_BOSS_SUN_TEXT_1">Prolonged anti-matter bombardment has melted the crust of this planet and started an unstable fusion reaction in the core. There is no time to think about the people who lost their lives here: the attack fleet is still in orbit and a gunboat approaches.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_C_EVENT_GUNBOAT_BOSS_SUN_TEXT_2">This forward beacon shows the eagle emblem of the Rebels. They must have brought it close to this sun to conceal the jump field. A surprise attack is already under way, multiple cruiser squadrons have arrived in the system and battle the local defenders. The patrol craft that is guarding the beacon spots you.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_C_EVENT_GUNBOAT_BOSS_SUN_TEXT_3">The battle in this region has gotten way out of hand. Contradicting information says that either Rebel or Federation ships have fired anti-matter weapons at the local star, in order to cause a supernova and obstruct the opponent's advance. A burned patrol boat picks you as its target.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_C_BOSS_CRUISER_TEXT_1">Although this sector is still under Federation control, an enemy cruiser has broken through the defensive lines. They hail you, "This is the RS 'Cut To The Chase'. You made it this far, but you won't get further. Target their engines!" They move in to engage.</text>

<text name="ce_textList_C_BOSS_CRUISER_TEXT_5">As soon as you arrive at the beacon, a Rebel cruiser turns to engage. How could they have gotten here so fast?

<text name="ce_eventList_QUEST_FED_BATTLE_1_2_c2_e">You make out the closest fighter craft and go after it. The capital ships continue to fire at each other.</text>

<text name="ce_eventList_QUEST_FED_BATTLE_1_LIST_2">Stray lasers hit your ship as the battle rages around you. Your pilot tries best to dodge all the wreckage. "Our flanks are threatened by several fighter squadrons at [encrypted]. Take some of them out, will you?" You pick your target.</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_QUEST_FED_BATTLE_1_LIST_3">You try to get in formation with the battle group, but the situation is too chaotic. "Free asset, break away from the fleet and engage the support ships at [encrypted]. Federation cruisers [encrypted] and [encrypted] will assist you.</text>

<text name="ce_eventList_QUEST_FED_BATTLE_2_1">You were supposed to meet up with your battle group here. However, only a few of the Federation ships have made it. "Free asset, be advised: Dynamic simulations no longer show any likelihood of overall success in this this sector. New orders from Federation high command suggest a full-out evacuation. But we have heard that you have a special mission. We'll do what we can to help."</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_QUEST_FED_BATTLE_2_2">You were supposed to meet up with your battle group here in order to finish the Rebel squadron. Something must have gone horribly wrong because the system is littered with the wrecks of Federation ships. An ambush? Reinforcements?</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_QUEST_FED_BATTLE_2_2_c1_e">It seems there is no stopping the Rebel fleet. You pick the bones of the ships and find a usable weapon.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_QUEST_FED_BATTLE_2_TEXT_1">As you pick through the debris a Rebel cruiser jumps in. They hail, "This is the RS 'Cleanup Crew'. We knew we would catch some stragglers here... but you? You are special! Prepare to meet your maker." They move in to engage.</text>

<text name="ce_textList_FIND_DRONE_FED_TEXT_1">An heavily defended space station circles an urbanized world. When you ask for help the local tech geeks transmit schematics for a drone.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_FIND_DRONE_FED_TEXT_2">A Federation cruiser squadron is moving in to reinforce this position. They transmit schematics for a drone to help you out.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_FIND_DRONE_FED_TEXT_3">You are surprised to find a couple of mothballed Federation cruisers in open space. The commanding officer of a lonely guard squadron authorizes you to take some of the ships' tech aboard. She explains that the local forces were unable to gather enough personnel to crew all the ships. Too many Federation officers have deserted to the Rebels and these ships will likely fall into the hands of the enemy as well.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_FIND_WEAPON_FED_TEXT_1">An entire Federation cruiser detachment lies dead in space. Battle analysis suggest that some of the crews have been suffocated when their life support systems where hacked, while other ships where taken over by hostile infantry squads and boarding drones. The Rebels did not event take the time to properly strip the ships, you find a weapon that has been left behind.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_FIND_WEAPON_FED_TEXT_2">The fleet in orbit around this planet is gearing up for their final defense effort. Upon transmitting your missions codes, a Federation repair ship is dispatched to install a weapon aboard your ship.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_NOTHING_FED_TEXT_1">Your jump leads you to nothing but empty space. This jump beacon serves no purpose other than as a connection. Scans reveal the debris of a Federation scout squadron is scattered through the entire system.</text>

<text name="ce_textList_NOTHING_FED_TEXT_8">Your jump leads to a remarkable binary star system. An encrypted hazard beacon warns of minefields nearby, undoubtedly laid by the Federation to help protect their evacuation forces.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_NOTHING_FED_BATTLE_TEXT_1">You arrive to see a number of Federation forward carriers and dreadnoughts. This must be a system of high importance to warrant such a fleet. A small Rebel detachment is approaching, but they are still far away.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_NOTHING_FED_BATTLE_TEXT_2">There are a few Federation fleets in the nearby area as well as a lot of wreckage. There must have been minor skirmishes in the area. Scanners show at least one battle is still raging at the far edge of the system.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_NOTHING_FED_BATTLE_TEXT_3">A few scattered heavy vessels are left to defend the nearby Federation settlement. They seem to be in the process of evacuation. Two Rebel battle cruisers are stationed near the systems sun, probably evaluating if when to attack.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_NOTHING_FED_BATTLE_TEXT_4">A large host of Federation heavy vessels are in formation around the beacon.

<text name="ce_textList_C_EVENT_CIVILIAN_TRANSPORT_FED_TEXT_3">A civilian transport hails, "You are the good guys right? Maybe you can guard us until we jump? So much battling and planet bombarding going on here, can't really tell anymore who represents what. We want to get out of this sector as fast as possible."</text>
<text name="ce_textList_C_EVENT_CIVILIAN_TRANSPORT_FED_TEXT_4">A civilian recharges its FTL at this beacon. They greet you, "Wow, nice cruiser you have there... We are an almost unarmed merchant vessel and we are no threat OK?" They seem to feel threatened.</text>

The Rebels take the town. You receive a few angry and desperate messages, asking why you did not intervene. The shuttles regroup in space and jump away.</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_CE_DISTRESS_AIRSUPPORT_RESULTS_1">You blast down to the surface, over the town and towards the advancing Rebel forces. Your ship's weapons tear through their ranks, disabling armored targets and foot-soldiers alike.</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_CE_DISTRESS_AIRSUPPORT_RESULTS_1_c1_e">As you go in for a second run their AA guns are charged and fire off an impressive barrage. Your ship takes some damage and you have to abort the attack run but you bought the civilians some time. Back in orbit, an escaping shuttle offers to unload some supplies as thanks.</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_CE_DISTRESS_AIRSUPPORT_RESULTS_2">You fly a wide circle and bring the ship down into a large canyon system. Approaching the Rebel forces from behind, you take out their AA tanks first and then fly a second run to decimate their forces further. The Rebels halt their offensive. For now.</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_CE_DISTRESS_AIRSUPPORT_RESULTS_2_c1_e">You bought the civilians some time. Back in orbit, a shuttle offers to unload some supplies as thanks.</text>

Lets hope that we all get out of this somehow, right? If you want my opinion: Tully threw us all into the fire here." Your map has been updated.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_CE_FED_DESERTER_TEXT_1">The fighting has died down in this system. A large assortment of still-glowing scrap hulks marks the site of a major battle. In the distance, Rebel gunboats hunt down the remaining Federation forces. A ship flagged with a 'deserter' tag is charging its drive nearby.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_CE_FED_DESERTER_TEXT_2">The Federation has taken heavy losses here, but the admiralty refuses to give up this beacon. Com chatter indicates that many captains started disobeying direct orders to save their crews lives.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_CE_FED_DESERTER_TEXT_3">A intense battle is fought on the other side of this planet. But a few Federation ships just calmly charge their drives at this beacon. "We have been ordered to retreat with our squadron." You doubt that this is true.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_CE_FED_DESERTER_TEXT_4">Another battle is raging here, but the only ships in close vicinity are with the Federation. You hail them and they state that they are evacuating the wounded. A message from local battle command contradicts this: "Free asset, be advised: These units have disobeyed direct orders. You are ordered to open fire on the deserters."</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_CE_FED_DESERTER_LIST_1">"We ain't going back, we'd rather die here!" They had their chance...</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_CE_FED_DESERTER_LIST_2">Facing your cruiser and its devastating arsenal, the deserters think twice about running. They swing their ship around and head towards the Rebel fleet. You know it's pointless, you've just sent these people to their death.</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_CE_FED_DESERTER_LIST_3">They don't seem inclined to follow your orders. "What for? Look at this sector, this is hopeless!"</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_CE_FED_DESERTER_LIST_3_c1">Tell them that there is still hope.</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_CE_FED_DESERTER_LIST_3_c1_e">"You command this ship everyone talks about? A standard beam cruiser? I thought they would send some high tech stealth craft.

There is only so much a single ship can do, but you never know...</text>
<text name="ce_textList_CE_PDS_FED_TEXT_1">You are too late to save anyone here. The main planet of this system has already been taken over by your enemy and the powerful planetary defense beams of the once mighty Federation are now in Rebel hands.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_CE_PDS_FED_TEXT_2">The current star charts show this system still under Federation control, but a local space dock informs you that the whole planetary government has defected to the Rebels.

<text name="ce_textList_CE_PDS_FED_TEXT_3">This planet is bustling with civilian activity. You consider ferrying some refugees to the next beacon, but Rebel ground troops have taken over several military bases on the surface and are in control of the point defense beams.</text>

<text name="ce_textList_CE_PDS_FED_2_TEXT_1">You find yourself directly between two fleets engaged in fierce combat here. The Federation detachment is distracted by a swarm of fighters and the Rebel artillery is pounding away at the mighty cruisers.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_CE_PDS_FED_2_TEXT_2">Two fleets are volleying shots at each other in this area. A Federation cruiser in pristine condition is torn to pieces right in front of you by a Rebel artillery strike. You doubt you will get through this without being noticed.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_CE_PDS_FED_2_TEXT_3">Your receive a priority hail from a decimated Federation cruiser squadron, "Free asset, you are ordered to retreat immediately. Multiple cruiser squadrons are converging on this beacon. Artillery spotters are in the area. I repeat: Retreat immediately."</text>

<text name="ce_textList_BS_PIRATE_SUICIDE_START_TEXT_2">Your scanners register impressive energy spikes. The station seems to be equipped with an improvised FTL core which has been set to overload.

<text name="ce_textList_BS_PIRATE_SUICIDE_SUCCESS_TEXT_2">The station is torn apart by a violent explosion. Dead pirates and debris are blasted towards your ship and you can't manage to evade all the wreckage. Your ship suffers collision damage.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_BS_PIRATE_SUICIDE_SUCCESS_TEXT_3">The vidscreen automatically turns grey and shields your eyes from the bright explosion that completely annihilates the station. Your crew braces for impact as your ship is caught in the massive blast wave. These pirates must have been completely nuts.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_BS_PIRATE_SUICIDE_SUCCESS_TEXT_4">As the station's FTL system ignites parts of it jump into higher dimension while most of it remains in front of you and conventionally explodes. A major structural component is sent flying towards you. Too big to be stopped by your shields it tears a substantial hole in your hull.</text>

You put full power to the engines but cannot evade the following explosion. Debris parts smash through your shields and damage the ship.</text>
<text name="ce_ship_BS_REBEL_QUEST_SUPPLY_destroyed">The station breaks apart and the fuel depot ignites, leaving the place burning in multicolored chemical fires. The asteroid barrage further obstructs your salvaging attempts, but at last your newfound guerrilla friends hail you again, "Nicely done Sir, we saw the whole thing."</text>
<text name="ce_ship_BS_REBEL_QUEST_SUPPLY_destroyed_c1_e">"This place is too exposed; we need to jump now, but you might find this useful. Good luck out there." They transmit some stolen Rebel security codes and the coordinates of an enemy weapons depot. This might be worth a look.</text>
<text name="ce_ship_BS_REBEL_QUEST_SUPPLY_deadCrew">Their station goes quiet and your crew salvages as much as possible. Solid-PXt005 hails you, and again you have no idea where they are. "Nicely done Sir, we saw the whole thing. This place is too exposed, we need to jump now but you might find this useful. Good luck out here." They transmit some stolen Rebel security codes and the coordinates of an enemy weapons depot. That might be worth a look.</text>
<text name="ce_ship_BS_ROCK_COLONY_destroyed">The Rock colony breaks apart under the heavy pounding. Its many underground tunnels are split open and the inhabitants drift into open space, quickly suffocating. You send in a full salvage team.</text>
<text name="ce_ship_BS_ROCK_COLONY_deadCrew">The asteroid is finally emptied of enemy Rockmen. You feel little remorse for slaughtering beings made mostly of inorganic materials. A full salvage teams returns with a lot of usable equipment.</text>
<text name="ce_ship_BS_ENGI_DRONE_gotaway">The station's FTL ignites and leaves a massive ripple in real-space. The whole Engi station jumps away.</text>
<text name="ce_ship_BS_ENGI_MEDICAL_MANTIS_CONTROLLED_destroyed">The station's structural integrity fails and it decompresses and breaks apart. Reactor leaks emit some of the highest radiation spikes you have ever seen. It is unclear how many Engi survived the battle with the Mantis, but they definitely didn't survive this. You collect some scrap and hasten to get our of here.</text>
<text name="ce_ship_BS_ENGI_MEDICAL_MANTIS_CONTROLLED_deadCrew">Your scanners pick up no more Mantis life signs on the station, the boarding party has been defeated. You scan for surviving Engi.</text>

<text name="ce_ship_BS_SLUG_CIVILIAN_surrender_c1_e">You power down your weapons and tell them that you've made a mistake. They station refuses all communications. Soon several militia scouts jump in. Time to get out of here.</text>
<text name="ce_ship_BS_SLUG_CIVILIAN_destroyed">The Slug station breaks apart and your systems returns to normal. You collect as much scrap as you can.</text>
<text name="ce_ship_BS_SLUG_CIVILIAN_deadCrew">With their crew dead, you quickly shut off their hacking module and your systems returns to normal. You strip the entire station.</text>
<text name="ce_ship_BS_CORPORATION_destroyed">The station's generator core overloads and blows the installation to atoms. Mr. Johnson will probably not be too happy, but you could still meet him at the coordinates he has given you.</text>
<text name="ce_ship_BS_CORPORATION_destroyed_c1_e">Your crew reports, "FTL charged and ready, Sir!"</text>
<text name="ce_ship_BS_CORPORATION_deadCrew">You dock at the station and search for any remaining Rebel Space Marines. You find the whole squad is dead. During your sweep your crew discovers some valuable tech in one of the lab rooms.</text>

<text name="ce_ship_CE_CORPORATION_CUSTOM_deadCrew">You find Mr. Johnson with blood on his suit amongst his dead corporate troopers. "Well done, Captain... My supervisors will not like this..."

<text name="ce_ship_BS_FED_SCIENCE_destroyed">Your weapons hit a critical section and the science station's supplies combust, incinerating the whole installation in chemical fires that are visible for many klicks. You scrap what little remains of it. Scanners indicate some drone tech was on board but it is useless now.</text>
<text name="ce_ship_BS_FED_SCIENCE_deadCrew">Your crew suits up and carefully searches the station. They make sure all the infected are dead and also discover a drone schematic in one of the labs. You order the station's generator core set to overload and prepare to jump.</text>
<text name="ce_ship_C_REBEL_CRUISER_FLEET_destroyed">You did it! The cruiser's weapons systems overload, munitions explode and the ship is torn apart.

<text name="ce_ship_ROCK_PIRATE_ESCAPE_surrender_c2_e">The ship disappears into the field. Maybe they will get crushed by asteroids but you have to assume they know the terrain and will live to harass other vessels. The weapons officer powers down the guns and you return to the beacon.</text>

<text name="ce_ship_PIRATE_FUGITIVE_deadCrew">The pirate goons have been killed and the ship no longer offers resistance. You send in a salvage crew.</text>
<text name="ce_ship_PIRATE_FUGITIVE_deadCrew_c1">Search the ship for the fugitive.</text>
<text name="ce_ship_TARGET_PRACTICE_destroyed">The decommissioned ship hull breaks apart. You totally wrecked this defenseless, imobile dummy.</text>
<text name="ce_ship_C_REBEL_GUNBOAT_FUEL_gotaway">The patrol craft jumps away. They will certainly inform the fleet of your exact location, allowing the Rebels to close in even faster.</text>
<text name="ce_ship_PIRATE_REFUEL_gotaway">The pirate jumps away, leaving you to examine the refueling platform. They left a few fuel capsules behind.</text>
<text name="ce_ship_PIRATE_REFUEL_destroyed_c1_e">You to examine the refueling platform. A few fuel capsules have been left behind.</text>
<text name="ce_ship_PIRATE_REFUEL_deadCrew">The pirates are dead and the ship goes quiet. You send in a salvage crew and let them strip the ship of anything useful.</text>
<text name="ce_event_START_BEACON_LANIUS_ACTUAL_c3">(Production Augment) Produce something on-board.</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_CE_BOUNTY_LIST_LANIUS_4">There are no legal marks available in this sector. Most people have already left.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_NOTHING_LANIUS_5">You question a local settlement and they describe a fleet of metal ships wordlessly collecting all of the abandoned metal and debris in the area. When they approached important satellites, the settlements fired a few PDS warning shots. The Lanius moved on despite clearly having the firepower to overwhelm the settlements.</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_CE_PLAYER_SURRENDER_LANIUS_1_c1_e">The Lanius don't care about space combat etiquette, all they ever want is more metal. They send a curiously phrased List, detailing which parts of your ship they will strip bare. "After... you... free!"</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_CE_PLAYER_SURRENDER_LANIUS_1_c1_e_c1">Comply and let them ravage your ship.</text>

<text name="ce_eventList_CE_PLAYER_SURRENDER_LANIUS_3_c1_e">The Lanius don't care about space combat etiquette, all they ever want is more metal. They send a curiously phrased List, detailing which parts of your ship they will strip bare. Then they send a text-only message: "After... you... free!"</text>
<text name="ce_textList_CE_PLAYER_SURRENDER_LANIUS_TEXT_1">The Lanius ship stands down and a ghastly voice hails you: "Meeeeeetaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaal!"</text>
<text name="ce_textList_CE_PLAYER_SURRENDER_LANIUS_TEXT_2">The Lanius ship stands down and hails: "Material... required." This was to be expected...</text>
<text name="ce_textList_CE_PLAYER_SURRENDER_LANIUS_TEXT_3">Communications report that the Lanius are answering you hail. What must be the captain appears on screen, but says nothing. The ship just approaches you, scrap recovery arms extend from all over it.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_CE_PLAYER_SURRENDER_LANIUS_TEXT_4">The Lanius open a channel. You put up a show and beg for your live, wondering if they will understand anything you say.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_CE_PLAYER_SURRENDER_LANIUS_TEXT_5">The computer tries to translate your surrender message. The Lanius seem to understand.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_CE_PLAYER_SURRENDER_LANIUS_SUCCESS_TEXT_1">You receive a message: "Thank...I." The Lanius craft proceeds towards your ship and its scrap recovery arms start to rip your hull plating apart. You wonder how long this will go on and suddenly feel very vulnerable. Strangely enough the Lanius head off before causing too much damage. This could have ended worse.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_CE_PLAYER_SURRENDER_LANIUS_SUCCESS_TEXT_2">You hand over some scrap from your reserve, but this does not prevent the Lanius from striping your ship of some of its hull plating. Then they head away without another word.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_CE_PLAYER_SURRENDER_LANIUS_SUCCESS_TEXT_3">The Lanius strip away some of your armor, but it seems they are quickly satisfied. You receive a last message before they jump away: "Tribute: ... acceptance."</text>

<text name="ce_event_LANIUS_RESEARCHER_CONTACT_c3_e">Your on-board libary is full of Lanius speech samples you recorded while traveling through the sector. The data could be very helpful to these scientists.</text>
<text name="ce_event_LANIUS_RESEARCHER_CONTACT_c5">They are an easy target. Seize their equipement!</text>
<text name="ce_event_LANIUS_TRADER_TRANSLATOR_c4_e">The Lanius cant be trusted. You open fire on the vessel without a warning.</text>
<text name="ce_event_LANIUS_SCARED_CIVILIAN_c4_e">Your crewmember opens a channel with them. It seems they are scouting for a merchant's guild which is seeking to establish connections with the other sentient races. You suggest they invest research time into developing better translators and ask to see if they are selling anything at the moment.</text>
<text name="ce_event_LANIUS_PIRATE_BOARDERS_c1">(Teleporter Disruptor) Secure the ship against teleporting intruders.</text>

<text name="ce_event_LANIUS_PIRATE_BOARDERS_c2_e">You hear the sounds of someone beaming aboard followed by the shouts of a boarding party. Intruder alert!</text>
<text name="ce_event_CE_LANIUS_DECONSTRUCT">The lone Lanius you meet at this beacon flies a dilapidated, dimly lit shuttle. You are surprised that the being is almost fluent in the Federation language: "Unique service available! Metal necessary for survival. Death approaching. Agree to hull deconstruction? Much metal for you! Beneficial for all!"</text>
<text name="ce_event_CE_LANIUS_DECONSTRUCT_c1">Allow the Lanius to deconstruct 4 points of hull.</text>
<text name="ce_event_CE_LANIUS_DECONSTRUCT_c1_e">"Gratitude is dispensed." The Lanius emerges from its craft and starts to dismantle your ship, feeding on the parts while gathering them into neatly arranged piles. The remaining material might be put to good use elsewhere now. "Service complete. Have a nice day."</text>
<text name="ce_event_CE_LANIUS_DECONSTRUCT_c2">Allow the Lanius to deconstruct 7 points of hull.</text>
<text name="ce_event_CE_LANIUS_DECONSTRUCT_c3">Allow the Lanius to deconstruct 10 points of hull.</text>

<text name="ce_event_CE_LANIUS_DECONSTRUCT_c4_e_c2">Allow the Lanius to deconstruct 6 points of hull.</text>
<text name="ce_event_CE_LANIUS_DECONSTRUCT_c4_e_c3">Allow the Lanius to deconstruct 8 points of hull.</text>
<text name="ce_event_CE_LANIUS_DECONSTRUCT_c5_e">The Lanius on the screen holds up a plastic panel showing a badly drawn frown-face. "Sadness approaches."</text>
<text name="ce_event_CE_LANIUS_DECONSTRUCT_c6">Destroy the shuttle.</text>
<text name="ce_event_CE_LANIUS_DECONSTRUCT_c6_e">The craft is atomized by a full weapon salvo. You really showed that Lanius.</text>
<text name="ce_event_CE_LANIUS_STRANDED">You detect life signs ahead. A couple of Lanius float helpless among a few scorched debris parts. The area is littered with corpses of their own dead. Looks like the ship is shipwrecked and adrift in space. They won't last long out here, radiation or starvation will make them perish sooner or later.</text>
<text name="ce_event_CE_LANIUS_STRANDED_c1">Rescue the Lanius and take them to safety.</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_CE_LANIUS_STRANDED_RESCUE_1">You open the airlocks and take the Lanius aboard. The group is grateful, but also completely starved. Soon they start to feed from your ship. Your crew tries to reason with the survivors but the situation escalates quickly.</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_CE_LANIUS_STRANDED_RESCUE_3">You open the airlocks and take the Lanius aboard. The group is grateful and their leader keeps a tight reign over them. Any attempts of the survivors to feed from your ship is immediately punished. One of the younger Lanius speaks some fed-standard. It inquires if there are "work involvements available" in exchange for "food".</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_CE_LANIUS_STRANDED_RESCUE_3_c1">Hire the Lanius and feed it 30 scrap.</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_CE_LANIUS_STRANDED_RESCUE_3_c1_e">The Lanius leader agrees to let his kind go, under the condition of being allowed to contact the local Lanius forces. They fix a pickup point and you drop the remaining survivors at a small science satellite. A dark Lanius warship that refuses any hails jumps in soon after and teleports them away.</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_CE_LANIUS_STRANDED_RESCUE_3_c2_e">You neither have the time nor the scrap to deal with a hungry Lanius youngling aboard your ship. The survivors are dropped off at the next save beacon and you hope to have seen the last of them.</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_CE_LANIUS_STRANDED_LEAVE_1">You prepare to charge the drive, but the Lanius seem unwilling to accept their fate. Many of them still have fuel in their booster packs. They propel themselves towards your ship. A first wave of Lanius sacrifice themselves to deplete your shields, after that a second group breaches through your hull and begins to wreck havoc.</text>
<text name="ce_eventList_CE_LANIUS_STRANDED_LEAVE_2">You watch as the helpless Lanius tumble through space while the FTL drive charges. These creatures brought this upon themselves and probably deserve it. Right?</text>
<text name="ce_textList_BS_EVENT_LANIUS_TEXT_1">A station is guarding this beacon - the Lanius have detected your arrival and are powering up their weapons!</text>
<text name="ce_textList_BS_EVENT_LANIUS_TEXT_2">A Lanius weapon platform is located at this beacon. Who knows from where the Scavengers have toed it here? They hail your ship, but the translator barely can cope with their language: "... metallic opportunity... acquisition... by force..." Looks like they won't let you go in peace.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_BS_EVENT_LANIUS_TEXT_3">You arrive to discover a fully weaponized Lanius station. How could they have built these things so fast? The installation is busy using its scrap recovery arms to tear a Rebel auto-scout apart, but powers up the weapons when registering you.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_BS_EVENT_LANIUS_TEXT_4">You receive a message on a wide band frequency, originating from a small Lanius station. It appears not to be directed at you, but your translator does its best all the same: "... metallic opportunity... acquisition... by force..." Looks like you're in for a fight.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_BS_EVENT_LANIUS_TEXT_5">A weaponized Lanius station has been constructed here. The installation seems fully functional and the Lanius activate their weapon arrays when you passively scan it for weakspots. You prepare for combat.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_BS_EVENT_LANIUS_TEXT_6">The Lanius have converted materials salvaged from this planet into a fully functional battle station. They open fire before you have a chance to hail.</text>
<text name="ce_textList_STORE_LANIUS_7">The Lanius have picked this entire planet clean. Now their trade vessels sell whatever the metal beings cannot absorb. You wonder what happened to the planets population.</text>
